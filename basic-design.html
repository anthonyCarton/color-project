	<p>The Basic Design titles address foundational art and design studies from many viewpoints and include a chapter or section that examines color as a design element. They either support a broad approach to visual studies and studio production or focus on two- or three-dimensional design. A few basic design books from related areas, such as theater design, that feature especially clear explanations of color and light are included. While many of these books are intended for college-level students, some of the general or classic works by influential artists and designers will be of more interest to the advanced reader than to the beginner.</p>
    <p>In a separate second section, Introduction to Design and Art Appreciation (224 - 267), are books that provide an introduction to the language of art and design and offer various overviews of formal elements and design principles. Since many of these books are undocumented, we make special note when documentation or references are included. Some older books are included for their historic perspective.</p>

<section id="introPara">
    <p>These design books offer a broad range of perspectives. Some texts emphasize studio experience while others prepare for but do not include art production. Others combine an overview of the history, theory, and meaning of art and design with related studio experiences that are more or less prescriptive, ranging from the traditional to the novel. A few current books incorporate video, film, and electronic media. Some are suitable for a term-long two-dimensional design course, while a few other texts support a year-long foundations program. The “color theory” presented in many of these books is remarkably similar. It usually consists of a hue circle, generally based on traditional painters’ primaries, a review of basic color harmony based on relationships such as complementary hues and analogous colors or triads and tetrads; and reference to Munsell’s three dimensions of color. When there are exceptions or innovations we point them out.</p>
    <p>The highly recommended books offer a good introduction to the visual arts for the general reader as well as for the targeted audience. Because they provide a broad overview no prior knowledge is required. The best books are clearly written present a broad range of design and color topics, include a section on the nature of color and light, color perception, and color theory, are well designed and generously illustrated, and feature some combination of the following: index, bibliography, and glossary. The best books for studio courses provide appropriate exercises for students.</p>
