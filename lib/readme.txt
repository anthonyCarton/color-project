Hello,

This is M. Bagley's "Color in design" bibliography site. It's in process, so no need to make it live. I'm working with Dr. Chu on this site, and Theresa Tichich is also aware of the project in case you have now idea who is building some site on your testing server. I would want to know if someone was messing around in my sandbox...

Notes:

All existing pages need to have head removed and replaced with generic <head>

Better yet it looks like delete lines 1-56 and replace with this head and then an open body tag.
