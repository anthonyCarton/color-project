	<p>Although many of the books selected for this Graphic and Visual Communication section cover a broad range of topics, they are arranged according to their major emphasis. This category includes, appropriately, a number of spectacular publications that are created by professional production teams of writers, editors, researchers, designers and photographers that reach a very high standard of color printing.</p>

</section>
<h1 class="pageTitle">Graphic and Visual Communication</h1>

<section id"introPara">
    <p>Advertising Design and Marketing includes books with information on the use of color in business and industry as a marketing tool. They address color within the context of product development, merchandising, advertising, and display.</p>
    <p>Color Reproduction and Printing Technology provides a listing of books that examine the design process and printing industry technology. This section also includes books with color systems, devised by design writers such as Hickethier and Kueppers, that enable designers to specify CMYK percentages for four-color printing. Information on commercially available color standards, inks and papers based on color systems and atlases such as PantoneÂ® or Munsell are to be found under Color Order Systems (85 - 105). Practical guides that show various color combinations intended to help designers visualize colors groupings and specify CMYK percentages for printing are listed under Design Guides to Color Combinations (442 - 449).</p>
    <p>Drawing and Illustration includes a small group of books that contain chapters or sections on color, some of which are surprisingly valuable, especially when compared with the treatment of color theory in basic design texts or introductory color texts. These books also introduce various media and techniques for using color in drawing and illustration.</p>
    <p>Graphic Design includes books that focus on the role of color in graphic design, general works with sections on color, and specialized books on type and color. The recent importance of color in Newspaper Design has inspired new publications specific to color, as well as chapters in general works on the use of color in newspaper design.</p>
    <p>Although books on Packaging Design have been on the scene since the 1920s, most of the nine books listed here treat color in a section, and only two focus entirely on color in packaging (Birren 475, Favre 476). Some very brief discussions of the subject can also be found in books that focus on Graphic Design. The books listed under Photography have at least a section on color theory and the nature of color, although they tend to emphasize the technology involved in color photography and photographic color printing. Only one focuses entirely on color design (Mante 496).</p>
    <p>Since many of these books emphasize design practice and application, they are generally accepted at face value by students and practitioners for their usefulness. As a group these books often lack the documentation, lists of references, or bibliographies found in scholarly researched books, and many of these writers do not reveal their sources. So we make special note when these features are included.</p>
    <p>While some books focus on technical information for practitioners, the most highly recommended books have a broad scope, are well designed and illustrated, and balance color theory with practical information. Ideally, that information is substantiated. Some older titles of particular historic interest are included.</p>
