	<p>The richly varied books in this category are broad in scope, often reflecting a visual arts viewpoint or written for a visual arts audience. Many are by renowned writers in the field who address the nature of color and examine theory to inform practice. Sometimes theoretical explanations are combined with a practical component or general instructional objective. A few writings on color theory and practice by historic figures are included.</p>
	<p>They are organized into five groups, from more general to more specialized. This section does not include titles on color theory and practice in apparel and textiles, architecture, interior and graphic design design which are to found in Part 3.</p>
</section>
<h1 class="green">General color theory and practice</h1>
<section id="introPara">
    <p>Books in the first group, Color Theory and Practice: General, offer a broad overview of general, color principles and concepts that apply to color expression in any medium. These highly informative books include exhaustive references that will be useful to practitioners, educators, and students alike.</p>
    <p>However, books geared to teaching and study of color at the college level, and accounts of color courses are in the second group: Color Courses: Texts and References. The reader interested in a history of color instruction will find interesting examples here. These often follow a pattern that consists of an introduction to subtractive pigment color and sometimes additive color or light; a hue circle such as a traditional 12-color wheel or a 10-hue Munsell hue circle; a summary of one or more color systems; a listing of traditional color harmonies based on complements, analogous colors, and so on, for selecting colors within a specific context; and a survey of color phenomena such as simultaneous contrast. Exercises for students are sometimes included. When writers move beyond theconventional framework, we make note of it. </p>
    <p>Third, books on Color and Design in Specific Media offer a specific but limited view of color, with considerable detail, and combine theoretical and practical concerns. These sometimes take the form of a workshop based on the author’s personal teaching or studio experience. Sometimes study of color and composition is combined with technical information on studio production. Technical “how-to” books are not included unless they include significant background information. </p>
    <p>The fourth group, Color Guides and Paint Mixing Systems, offers practical information for mixing colors in paint. Some of these books provide conceptual and practical information for organizing colors into orderly circles or cylinders that lead to controlled color mixing, which can be useful to illustrators and painters as well as to students and educators. The fifth and most specialized group includes four titles on “Colorants for Ceramics and Metals.” </p>
    <p>The most highly recommended books combine excellent writing and color plates, and often feature superb graphic design by professional book production teams. Since many are by practitioners who base their writing on their own personal experience, these books usually are accepted at face value for their usefulness. Many books in this group are undocumented, so we make special note of exceptions. While many books are recent, some titles offer a historic perspective, including a few compilations that provide easy access to writings on color theory and practice by artists and designers. </p>
    <p>Many of the references and texts for color study follow the tenets of two leading 20th-century color educators: Johannes Itten and Josef Albers. Discussions based on their writings are pointed out, sometimes on the basis of limited clues. For example, presentations of color “extension” with numerical formulas based on the light values of colors are attributed to Goethe are based on Itten. Albers correctly credits Schopenhauer for devising these ratios.</p>
