New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1971. 160 pp. Index, bibl., glossary, B/W illus., color illus. </p><p class="annot">The authors present weavers and needleworkers with an outline ofcolor theory that can be modified to fit each fiber medium. A brief history of color theory is followed by a discussion of equipment and materials. In a chapter on color and design, the authors present the “Justema palette” which consists of 38 colors that include pure hues, eight pastels, eight supplementary colors, ten neutrals, and black and white. Some of the color plans and projects illustrated in the remaining chapters now appear dated, but this work may serve as a good starting point for fiber artists interested in applying color theory in their work. </p></div>
