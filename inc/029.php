<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib special">29. Wagner, Carlton. The Wagner Color Response Report. Santa Barbara, CA: Wagner Institute for Color Research, 1985. Variously paginated.</p><p class="annot">Wagner contends that color theory is unimportant; decisions about color should be based primarily on consumer response. He states that response to color is inborn, learned, geographic or regional, ethnic, and gender linked and can be affected by light, climate, socioeconomic position and sophistication. Responses to red, orange, yellow, blue, blue-green, green, brown, gray, white, and black are explained but not related specifically to the colors swatches that accompany the text. An accompanying seven-page pamphlet “Let Your Colors Do the Talking,” discusses the visual impression created by wardrobe colors. He states that men prefer red-based colors and women prefer blue-based colors. Colors mentioned in the pamphlet can be found among the 100 swatches in the Wagner Color Response Dictionary, which are labeled with color name and response by gender, socioeconomic status, and other similar information. The straightforward presentation of a large quantity of information makes this a far more useful publication than Wagner’ Color Power. Nevertheless, many readers will find the lack of illustrations and documentation frustrating.</p></div>
