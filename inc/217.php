Aberystwyth, 1982. 37 pp. B/W illus. </p><p class="annot">This little-known work by the Director of Visual Art Studies of the University College of Wales proposes an ingenious method of combining ideal color and specific pigments into an imagined three-dimensional color cylinder that addresses the needs of painters. Holding that all pure, intense colors are of equal importance, Tinker replaces the painter’s usual primary and secondary hues with six irregularly spaced, intense colors that he calls “forces.” He explains how to paint color tracks for his cylinder that branch off to show the several ways pigments may be changed by mixing with white, neutrals, other hues, and complements, and also describes several experiments using colored gels placed over printed sheets. He acknowledges Fletcher’s Colour Control (1936) as a source he has amplified and refined. Other color systems, such as Ostwald’s reduce color mixing to hue plus white or black; in contrast, Tinker’s approach opens up color mixing possibilities and offers an innovative conceptual color model that relates to the realities of studio practice. </p></div>
