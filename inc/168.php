West Chester, PA: Schiffer, 1988. Unpaginated. Index, bibl., B/W illus., color illus. ISBN 0-88740-139-2. </p><p class="annot">This basic introduction to color and its perception, the outcome ofthe authorâ€™s teaching at the Basel School of Design in Switzerland, was originally published in German in 1985. Initial discussions of light and color and the appearance of color are followed by sections on the eye and colors created in the eye (e.g., optical mixing, afterimages, and simultaneous contrast). The organization of color, color effects, color significance, and color reproduction in photography and printing and on computer screens are also covered. The 509 neat images, the lucid text, and logical progression of ideas make this an exceptionally appealing and useful, though not comprehensive, survey of color. </p></div>
