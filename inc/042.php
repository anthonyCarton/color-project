<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib special">42. Frisby, John P. Seeing: Illusion, Brain and Mind. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1980. 160 pp. Index, bibl., B/W illus, color illus. ISBN 0-19-217672-2. </p><p class="annot">This book, which the author tells us started out as The General Readerâ€™s Fun Book of Visual Illusions, is a remarkably compelling account of how humans perceive their environment. Although the professed subject is illusion, most of the text addresses how, what, why, when, and where one sees, and discusses the interrelationship of psychological and physiological vision. The reader can enjoy this lively book for the many excellent illustrations of visual illusions or can read in depth about why the illusions work and how they relate to the body of knowledge on vision. Special eyeglasses with one red lens and one green lens for experiments of perception of three dimensions are provided. Though color itself is not given special emphasis, interesting color information related to vision and perception is included throughout the book. </p></div>
