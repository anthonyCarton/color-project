ISBN 0-671-24232-6.</p><p class="annot">In this work for the general reader, Lüscher describes four dominant feelings of self that correspond to the four colors red, green, blue, and I yellow, provides color disks for determining personality types, and states probable reactions and behavior patterns. He makes the dubious claim that “every specific color inspires not only the same perceptional stimulus, but also exactly the same experiential stimulus in every single individual.” For example, red is found to be stimulating whereas blue is relaxing. He adds that what is individual is the person’s feeling toward a color, which may be like, dislike, or indifference. He claims that thousands of subjects around the globe have taken his test, but he does not address or document gender differences, multicultural, or non-European populations. The publishers suggest that this guide is also “entertaining enough to be a parlor game.” Its value may be as a historic document of color testing efforts.</p></div>
