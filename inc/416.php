(070-6559-00 Tektronix part number.) </p><p class="annot">This concise and well-written book explains basic color theory with specific reference to color design on the computer, describes the process and options for converting the on-screen image to paper, and incorporates many handsome computer-generated visuals. Because the text is brief, those with a minimal background in color theory may want to supplement with additional reading. However, as an overview of both theory and application, this is an excellent resource. A catalog of Tektronix products for computer color output can be found at the end of the book. It should be noted that the firmâ€™s commercial ties to the field in no way detract from the general usefulness of this book. </p></div>
