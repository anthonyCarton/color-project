Garden City, NY: Doubleday, Doran, 1930. 410 pp. Index, B/W illus., color illus. </p><p class="annot">First published in 1918, this classic book on gardening in Americawas reprinted in 1990 by the Atlantic Monthly Press. The thoughtful treatment of color principles and garden color themes starts with chapter 1: “Colour in the Garden: A Confession of Faith.” Like Gertrude Jekyll, Louise Wilder aims to create “beautiful garden pictures” or compositions. Though Mrs. Beebe admires and frequently quotes the writings of English gardeners like Jekyll, she deplores the practice of imitating gardens designed for the mild English climate. Instead, she recommends a fresh and informal approach inspired by one’s sense of the place and the particular climate. Wilder’s discussions of “happy proportions” and color harmonies often lead to color scales or gradations, and mediating tones, which she prefers to sharp contrasts. However, her charming and leisurely essays are refreshingly free of color dogma as she describes many prospects of her own gardens in New York state, which are shown in paintings by Ann Winegar. Her frequent reference to the work of other writers provides an interesting survey of garden books and other literary sources. For example, she has the reader consult Ridgeways “Colour Standards and Colour Nomenclature” to better understand the color quality of “Magenta the Maligned.” The book is packed with practical information on the appearance and habits of the vast collection of plants she writes about, such as lists of Latin and English plant names; and charts of periods of flowering with plant names arranged in columns under seven color families. But what is most enduring here is the thoughtful writing, full of feeling and love of flowers and garden color. </p></div>
