<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib special">26. Varley, Helen, ed. Color. New York: Knapp, 1980. 256 pp. Index, bibl., glossary, B/W illus., color illus. ISBN 0-8148-0726-7.</p><p class="annot">This compilation of all aspects of color -- from architecture, culture, and nature to technology and even body-painting -- features the human response to color as a prevailing theme in a beautifully illustrated and encyclopedic survey of the world of color. The production team includes artist-designer Donald Pavey, who is sometimes credited with its authorship. A major section deals with the psychological effects of the six primary and secondary hue families and achromatic color. Though the many individual essays are not attributed and information is not documented, the glossary and the bibliography with over 360 titles recommended by the expert consultants, add to the bookâ€™s sefulness. This collection of fascinating information, curiosities, and trivia is both inspiring and entertaining.</p></div>
