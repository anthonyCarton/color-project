<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">174. Ellinger, Richard G. Color Structure and Design. New York: Van NostrandReinhold, 1963. 137 pp. Index, B/W illus., color illus. </p><p class="annot">Ellinger begins this textbook with a summary of the Munsell system,covers the spectrum and vision, and compares pigment colors to the colors of light. He then considers color in the context of the basic design principles of limitation, balance, dominance, and rhythm, and describes color harmony in terms of these principles. The author provides a useful method for analyzing and graphically representing color usage in design work. The text includes 22 projects for students. A 1980 paperback reprint is identical to the original 1963 textbook except that all of the color illustrations are grouped in the center of the book instead of at the end, and the brief and dated bibliography has been omitted. </p></div>
