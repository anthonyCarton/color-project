<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">424. Danger, Eric Paxton. The Colour Handbook: How to Use Colour in Commerce and Industry. Hampshire, England: Gower Technical, 1987. 687 pp. Bibl., B/W illus. ISBN 0-291-39717-4. </p><p class="annot">Danger’s comprehensive overview includes detailed information on lighting, color relativity, human response to color, and a wide variety of functions and uses of color. He provides specific guidelines for selecting colors for environments, products, and promotional materials. Of general interest is the analysis in the final section of the “attributes, applications, characteristics, properties, and uses of colors.” Warm, cool, bright, dull, light, medium, dark, pure, modified, neutral, strong, pastel, deep, and natural colors are discussed first, and then specific color families are considered in equal detail. This often-cited compendium of color information is amazingly broad ill its scope. Its major shortcoming is that with the exception of one black-and-white drawing of a hue circle, it is entirely unillustrated. Danger indicates that published information and well- conducted research are the basis for this work but does not reveal his sources. An 18-page bibliography lists books, articles, and reports. </p></div>
