Chicago: Paul Theobald, 1947.381 pp. Index, endnotes/footnotes, B/W illus., color illus. </p><p class="annot">Moholy-Nagy’s design education writings stem from his innovativeteaching at the Institute of Design in Chicago. His design ideas and student exercises are inspired by an interdisciplinary approach that draws freely from art, science, and technology. While color is mentioned only occasionally and briefly in the text, the 16-page chapter on painting includes interesting treatments of color perception, harmony, and historic color usage by painters. Some of his free-wheeling discussions include helpful notes and documentation. His approach to art remains visionary and future- oriented as he moves from pigment to photography to light -- indeed, he predicts that “most of the visual work of the future lies with the ‘light painter.’ ” </p></div>
