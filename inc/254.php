A refreshing overview of the basic elements and principles of design is followed by an excellent 12-page color chapter which covers the general attributes of color and light, color in paint, and interaction of colors. Other discussions specific to scene design address the modification of the appearance of painted scenery and dyed costumes by light. Color illustrations include Itten’s 12-hue circle and proportional hue circle. Other fine color plates show what the authors call “reactions” of adjacent colors caused by chroma and value, and the influence of colored hue surrounds on neutral grays. Additional explanations and demonstrations include cast shadow colors, color reflections, application of additive mixing principles to stage lighting, and control through color schemes and plots. The clear explanations of the practical application of additive color principles in the theater are inspiring. </p></div>
