Translated by Joachim N eugroschel. New York: Watson-Guptill, 1983. 188 pp. Index., B/W illus, color illus. ISBN: 0- 8230- 135 7-X. </p><p class="annot">This volume by a professor at the School of Architecture in Genoa has three major sections: learning to see, drawing from life, and seeing shape. While this may sound conventional, the author sweeps in a fascinating array of free-wheeling topics and themes. Ten-page units cover expected topics such as the “Study of the Nude,” or “Measurement and Drawing,” and “Psychology of Form” (on Gestalt psychology). Other sections discuss and illustrate the color spectrum, color values, the meanings of colors, and drawing with colors. Topics are illustrated by the work of leading artists. For example, in “The Signs and Strokes of Miro” the author explains possibilities for color sequences and proportion. Under “A Drawing a Day” a colored drawing by Klee is used as the basis for a colored pencil lesson. “Travel Notes” analyzes colored drawings by Delacroix, Gaugin, Klee, and Goethe, and black and white drawings of Le Corbusier. Examples of Western art and architecture are appropriately located on every page of the text and related to thoughtful teach-yourself exercises. Sometimes the organization seems jumbled as it combines analysis and essays, historic or contemporary examples, exercises and guidelines for working methods. This informative, exuberant, and marvelously imaginative book is the first volume in the series to be published in English. One hopes that the author’s four other titles on color theory, color and personality, and other design and drawing topics will become available to the English reader. </p></div>
