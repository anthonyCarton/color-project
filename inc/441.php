ISBN 0-87701-408-6. </p><p class="annot">This book presents more than 900 color combinations as prints and patterns organized according to type. Geometric patterns such as blocks, stripes, and plaids are followed by abstracts, florals, letterforms, children’s prints, Art Deco, mosaics, and ethnic patterns. Each pattern, which contains as few as two or as many as six different colors, is accompanied by CMYK printing formulas. The author explains that the purpose of the guide is to help designers visualize color combinations, and recommends that readers refer to books by Itten or De Grandis for color theory. The brief text describes the 2” x 2” color samples. Given the emphasis and the selection of patterns, this volume in the series will be of most interest to those working in apparel, fashion, interior design, and textile related fields. </p></div>
