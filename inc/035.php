ISBN 0-8159-5206-6.</p><p class="annot">The author recommends methodologies for color therapy, physical health, nutrition, and eye problems The publisher’s preface defines color therapy as “using color to influence human health” and notes that it is considered a category of “fringe medicine.” Stating that the FDA is inappropriately intolerant in its views on this form of “preventative medicine,” the book asks readers to read between the lines and exercise their imaginations whenever possible since how-to information cannot be provided without subjecting the author to prosecution or harassment. Faber Birren and Edwin Babbit are frequently cited throughout the text. The bibliography may compensate somewhat for a lack of documentation. However, most readers will find this book no more than a curiosity.</p></div>
