ISBN 0-88214-400-6.</p><p class="annot">The role of color in the ancient and modem world, in both Eastern and Western civilizations, is examined in six papers from The Realms of Color, the Eranos Yearbook. Adolf Portmann looks at color sense and meaning from the viewpoint of a biologist. Christopher Rowe discusses color concepts and symbolism in the ancient world. Black African color symbolism is described by Dominique Zohan. The Christian visionary experience and color is reviewed by Ernst Benz. Rene Huyghe looks at Westem art and the changing role played by color. Finally, Toshihiko Izutsu explains the negative attitude toward color in the Far East. The very specific information on color symbolism and color preferences provided may strike some readers as esoteric, but others will see applications for educators and professionals interested in color and culture. </p></div>
