ISBN 0-03-003257-1. </p><p class="annot">This interesting approach that integrates basic two-dimensional design and perception principles with graphic design background production and information. One third of the book consists of five chapters that explain the design process, graphic design history, perception, visual dynamics, and Gestalt principles. These prepare the student for the eight following chapters on text type, layout, preparing camera-ready art, color, advertising design, photography, illustration, and computer graphics. Exercises and projects for students conclude each chapter. A chapter on the dynamics of color explains color as light, describes a traditional color wheel attributed to Herbert Ives, and logically introduces prospective graphic design students to the printer’s cyan, magenta,and yellow as subtractive primaries. Instead of the traditional 12-hue circle, black and white diagrams show Munsell’s 10-hue circle, and an eight-hue circle, reminiscent of but not attributed to Ostwald, with Ostwald color names. Brief discussions of color combinations, color relativity, color psychology, and color associations lead up to an overview of color in printing. This well- illustrated text presents a manageable amount of information that will appeal to beginning students. The bibliography lists references for each chapter. </p></div>
