<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">427. Ketcham, Howard. Color Planning for Business and Industry. New York:Harper, 1958. 274 pp. Index, B/W illus., color illus. </p><p class="annot">With this work Ketcham introduced professional color planning to the American business world of the 1950s. He discusses the emotional impact of color and the use of color to improve both the utility and appeal of products and the productivity and satisfaction of workers and students in the workplace and schools. He also briefly reviews color usage from ancient Egypt to the Renaissance. A major portion of the book looks at examples of practical color usage from camouflage to transportation. While dated, this early work by an authority on color and lighting provides a good overview of the topic at a pecific point in time. It is interesting to compare this book to Sutnarâ€™s Package Design, which was published only five years earlier but fails to address the role of color in packaging. </p></div>
