ISBN 0-8230-0696-4. </p><p class="annot">Quiller’s color theory, presented as it is taught in his classes forpainters, is based on traditional pigment color relationships such as monochromatic and complementary. Color “schemes” are shown on an abstract color circle, as well as in his watercolor paintings. He also gives exercises and practical instruction on methods, such as the use of full intensity colors in small areas and applying “semi-neutrals” mixed from two complements in large passive areas. Grisaille or underpainting in neutrals to build the composition is also shown. Small serial images by the author demonstrate different colorways for the same composition. A section on using color out of the studio enables the reader to compare photographs of the subject on location with the author`s watercolor of the subject. The concluding section is a gallery of paintings by 28 master colorists selected by the author. The most valuable feature of this book may be the hue circle that incorporates 68 commercially available pigment colors.</p></div>
