ISBN 0-7063-6482-1. </p><p class="annot">The author tells how to create a color palette with plant materials andgives guidelines for selecting and combining plants on the basis of their seasonal color appearance. A selective list that recommends plants for their fall and winter color, with details on the height and general growth characteristics of each, will be useful for American gardeners who live in regions with similar growing conditions. The interesting text is balanced by many handsome full-page color photographs that provide glimpses of garden colors during the mild English winter. </p></div>
