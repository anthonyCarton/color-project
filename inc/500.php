In their introduction the editors summarize the presentations and basic questions poised by of each of the eight participants, all but three located at Cambridge University. David Bomford, Senior Restorer of Paintings at The National Gallery, London starts with Cennino Cennini’s famous treatise Il libro dell’ Arte (1390) in his overview of painting methods and significant discoveries in the history of color in art, down to Impressionism, all well illustrated. Artist Bridget Riley, discusses pictorial color from her viewpoint, tracing the history of the discoveries of the great colorists down to Seurat, Matisse, and Van Gogh. Physicist Malcolm Longair describes “some the classic experiments of the last 400 years” that inform our understanding of light and color. Denis Baylor, a visual physiologist at Stanford University, explains the “Colour Mechanisms of the Eye.” John Mollon, Reader in Experimental Psychology, discusses “Seeing Colour.” Not surprisingly, Peter Parks, marine biologist and film-maker, presents stunning photos of sea creatures and much more in his “Colour in Nature.” John Gage, Head of the Department of History of Art at Cambridge, offers his viewpoint in “Colour and Culture” to dedicated readers interested in perception as he traces afterimage color pairs and color systems influenced by cultural conditioning. Each scholar concludes with a list of books for further reading. As promised in the title, this fine and challenging work spans the vast domain of Colour Art and Science. </p></div>
