<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib special">450. Allen, Janet. Drawing. New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1980. 128 pp. Index, B/W illus., color illus. ISBN 0-442-24498-3. </p><p class="annot">This text places an unusually high priority on color in drawing. A 15- page “Handling Color” chapter follows the brief introduction and treatment of materials. The discussion of color theory includes mixing a hue circle with primary hues and mixing secondary hues from two primaries. Optical color is demonstrated in pencil exercises, in discussions of half-tone reproduction in printing, and in examples by artists. A color vocabulary is explained. Handsome color illustrations of works by artists known for their colored drawings masterworks provide the “criterion performance” on most pages. For example, drawings by Albrecht Diirer, Sonia Delaunay, and David Hockney enhance the color chapter. An “Improving Observation” chapter follows with exercises and projects for students. Other chapters on elements of composition, techniques, and handling the finished drawing complete the book. This teach-yourself text would be excellent for those who wish to integrate study of color with drawing. </p></div>
