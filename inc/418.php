<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib special">418. White, Jan V. Color for the Electronic Age. New York: Watson- Guptil, 1990. 208 pp. Index, bibl., glossary, appendix, B/W illus., color illus. ISBN 0-8230-0732-4. </p><p class="annot">The author’s themes are “color as value-added” and color as a “dialect of functional communication” in this practical publication aimed at the desktop publisher. Chapters are keyed to function and practical application of color in publication design, with specific guidelines for effective use of color in charts, graphs, typography, pictures and photographs. The color theory chapter centers on how color is used and how people see it. Other chapters cover the use of color to create continuity and identity; how color in charts may be used to explain and persuade; how color in typography can highlight meaning; how to add color to black-and- white pictures to enhance meaning or dramatic effect; and how to use color photographs to expose hidden values. A strength of the book is the method of illustrating a recommended principle or strategy with many variants of the same image, which makes for highly convincing visual evidence. In an appendix on specifying color that briefly explains the CIE, Munsell, Pantone®, and the Natural Color System, the author incorrectly states that Munsell colors can be purchased in art stores as Color-Aid papers. The Xerox Corporation supported the production of this easy-to-understand guide on color in publication design. </p></div>
