ISBN 0-8019-7275-2. </p><p class="annot">Hopper’s aim is to create a reference to ceramic materials incommonly used language that makes the information easily accessible. This collection of technical information on creating colors for ceramists shows what the author calls the “assisting factors, the inhibiting factors, and how to create specific colors.” The author deliberately eliminates the “dogma of chemistry and mathematics” so that “we can concentrate on the actual and observable reaction.” The heart of Hopper’s work is the ceramic spectrum section, which charts 42 colors in 134 variations, all with illustrations of the test tiles. A portfolio of the work of well-known potters accompanied by their own statements on method completes this unique book. </p></div>
