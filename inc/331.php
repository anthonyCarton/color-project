This book concentrates on those dyes, while noting those that can also dye cotton, silk, rayon, raffia, rushes, and other fibers used for basketry and garments. After briefly discussing fiber preparation, equipment, and dyeing procedures, the author explains mordants and their uses. Entries on dye plants presented in order of seasonal availability, include a description of the plant, mordants that may be used, and the method for dyeing. The same information is provided for dyes of historic importance, lichens, and dyes for cotton, linen and silk. Over-dyeing, use of dyed fibers, and planting a dye garden are also addressed. </p></div>
