New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1979. 374 pp. Index, bibl., glossary, B/W illus., color illus. ISBN 0-03-045471-9. </p><p class="annot">Designed as an interior design textbook for the college student, this book will also be useful to the general reader. The chapter on color includes discussions of hue, value, intensity, and traditional color harmonies. The review of color effects on feelings, size, and distance, and the suggestions for color use in interior design are particularly good. Some of the information included here has been adapted from Inside Todayâ€™s Home by Roy Nelson Faulkner, SuAnn Nissen, and Sarah Faulkner. However, with the exception of standard lists and tables, the text and most of the illustrations are new. </p></div>
