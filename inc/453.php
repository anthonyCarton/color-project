The design procedures chapter looks at design process from idea to final printed product. The discussion of color is limited to technical information on color reproduction in the printing process, including photo-mechanical reproduction of color, color separations and correction, screening half-tone color and the suitability of color originals. While this is a useful overview for the student or novice illustrator or graphic designer, those seeking practical information on color usage in design will probably be disappointed. </p></div>
