<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">287. Steven, John Culbert. Colourgenics as Body Language. London: W. Foulsham, 1987. 125 pp. Index, B/W illus. ISBN 0-572-01404-X. </p><p class="annot">Culbert presents his opinions on and interpretations of colorpreferences in clothing, declaring that the wearer’s personality, attitudes toward others, emotional contentment or discontent, and other aspects of the emotional and material sides of life can be discerned from clothing-color choices. He differentiates between inner and outer clothing, whether worn on the upper or lower body, and gives associations for nine color families, warm and cool colors, and male and female colors. This curious and undocumented book, with only one black-and-white illustration, may be of some interest to those seeking entertaining lore on “reading” character clues from clothing-color choices. Readers may wish to compare Steven’s verbal color test with the Liischer or Friehling color tests, which provide color samples. </p></div>
