New York: Praeger, 1984. 384 pp. Index, bibl., B/W illus., color illus. ISBN 0-03-062466-5.</p><p class="annot">This analysis of mutual influences between modem art and modem science provides “dramatic evidence for the thesis that there was influence from visual science or that the artist on his own had discovered the same visual phenomena that contemporary scientists were investigating.” Major chapter topics include light, color, space, and form in this context. A chapter titled “Color: Theorists in Science and Art” examines the connections between science and art and the influences that link Chevreul to Delacroix and Delaunay, Rood and Seurat, Denis and Monet, Henry and Delaunay. The work of Kupka, Kandinsky, Mondrian, Klee, Albers, Kelly, and others who contributed to the iconography of color theory is considered, as are Gestalt theory and the Gestalt artists. The many illustrations, diagrams, and documentary photographs on most pages, profuse and detailed notes, and the 368-item bibliography that draws from perception and psychology of art sources, makes this a very rich resource.</p></div>
