The formulas and recipes were recorded or developed in the 1920s by the Home Economics department at Wingate Vocational High School. The book includes general instructions, growing conditions for the 33 plants described and instructions for dye use. Drawings by Charles Keetsie Shirley show each whole plant, with a detail within the same composition to facilitate identification. </p></div>
