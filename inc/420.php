<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">420. Birren, Faber. Selling with Color. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1945. 244 pp. Index, bibl., B/W illus. </p><p class="annot">Birren discusses the psychology of color within the context of the sale of consumer goods, product development, merchandising, advertising, packaging, and display. He provides a broad overview of taste and color preferences and reviews color theory, systems, and symbolism. Birren states that his theories are supported by extensive research and sales records and then justifies the absence of rigorous documentation by rationalizing that the book is practical in nature and intended for a varied audience that would make little use of references. Nevertheless, it is an important early work. </p></div>
