Augusta:University of Maine at Augusta, 1981. pp. B/W illus., color illus. </p><p class="annot">In this presentation of field-event theory as “a conceptual model forthe study of design,” design principles are identified and related to a broad range of academic disciplines. Thus this thought-provoking book supports a conceptual and interdisciplinary approach for instruction of introductory design. Although brief, the sections on color focus on light and vision, and touch on simultaneous and successive contrast. </p></div>
