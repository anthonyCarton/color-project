ISBN 0-297-78729-2. </p><p class="annot">This popular guide, published in association with a television program for the “artist as decorator” covers all aspects of decorative painted finishes from walls, floors, and ceilings to furniture. This decorative tradition is beautifully illustrated with examples of wall paintings from Egyptian tombs, Pompeiian interiors, and 19th-century polychrome decorated rooms, and in the the work of contemporary English artist- decorators, muralists, and the “great illusionists.” A chapter on color basics for visual effect covers subjective colors, basic terms, complementaries, afterimage, and simultaneous contrast. Instead of the usual hue circle, pigments used by artist-decorators are shown on a wooden palette with a central group of the three traditional primaries and secondaries surrounded by eighteen related pigment colors. A discussion for the general reader recommends fail-safe color schemes such as neutrals, monochrome, grayed-pastel, and white-plus-one-color. Detailed instructions for mixing colors and for numerous decorative techniques are included. This is an inspiring yet practical resource for the interested reader. </p></div>
