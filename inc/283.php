ISBN 0-446-38552-2. </p><p class="annot">Molloy presents his views on managerial dress codes for men in theU. S. and abroad. He advocates a carefully calculated approach to clothing selection and purchase on the basis of the desired or appropriate image related to the business world. He claims that his recommendations, which cover every aspect of a “gentleman’s” personal wardrobe from ties to socks, are based on his own extensive research. He scatters brief generalizations on the negative or positive effect of clothing colors in the one- to two-page discussions of suitable color and color conventions that appear in most chapters, but he ignores the effect of color on personal appearance. </p></div>
