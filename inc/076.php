ISBN O-471-86776-4. </p><p class="annot">Intended to fill the gap between specialized scientific monographsand general books on color, this book begins with the nature of light and color. Color is discussed as it relates to electronic energy levels, compounds of transition elements, molecular orbitals, energy bands, and geometrical and physical optics. General readers will find much of the information complex and difficult to understand. However, the text is well written and can be skimmed by readers interested in the non-mathematical or nontechnical information it contains. </p></div>
