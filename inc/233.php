Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1914. 128 pp. B/W illus., color illus. </p><p class="annot">As suggested in the title, this book takes the form of progressivelessons that are illustrated with examples. The author’s central thesis is that composition or the “building up of harmony” is the fundamental process in art. He approaches composition by analyzing its main elements as line, value -- which he calls by the Japanese term notan -- and color. He considers each in turn and concludes with exercises that combine the three elements in unified harmonies. His well-reasoned lessons on the elements of color progressively increase in complexity of effect. This enduring guide to color as an integrated element in composition authored by a master teacher will reward the interested reader. </p></div>
