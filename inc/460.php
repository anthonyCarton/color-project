Cincinnati, Ohio: North Light, 1991. 144 pp. Index, B/W illus., color illus. ISBN 0-89134-404-7. </p><p class="annot">The basic premise here is that the principal functions of color in graphic design are to attract and hold attention, to convey information, and to make information memorable. This premise is put to the test in an ingenious presentation of color polarities that interpret nine contrasting “color moods:” cool/warm, passive/active, feminine/masculine, natural/artificial, exclusive/popular, individual/corporate, traditional/modem, classical/romantic, and retrospective/futuristic. For example, the introduction to the natural/artificial section uses a green background to drape the “natural” page, drapes the “artificial” page with a saturated acidic yellow, and repeats these two colors in the headings in the margins throughout the section. Five color themes are carefully discussed and illustrated in sequence for each color pair: color associations; combinations of hue, tone, and saturation; shapes and edges; size and proportion; and pattern and textures. The innovative and systematic organization, clear explanations, and fine examples of how color functions in package and product design, posters, and advertising from around the globe make this an outstanding reference for students and design professionals. Curiously, Itten’s 12-hue color circle and hue gradation schema are reproduced without attribution. </p></div>
