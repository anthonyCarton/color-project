ISBN 0-934026436-X. </p><p class="annot">The book explains the dyeing of natural fibers using union, fiber-reactive, acid, and pre-metallized dyes and provides basic dye recipes for each dye type. Except in the case of union dyes, the authors use a combination of English and metric measurements. That is, dry ingredients are measured in teaspoons or cups, while fiber is measured in grams, and wet ingredients are measured in liters. However, since a gram scale is necessary to weigh the fiber or yam, using it to measure the dry ingredients -- especially the dye powder -- would yield greater accuracy and more predictable and reproducible results. Topics include dyeing and record keeping for both yarn and fabric, dip-dyeing, resist, rainbow dyeing, over- dyeing, and double-dyeing, and instructions are given for thirteen projects. There is a short but adequate discussion of color theory. An English metric conversion chart, brand and scientific name charts, list of suppliers, glossary, and bibliography round out the book. The beginning dyer will find this an accessible introduction to the subject, the more serious dyer may prefer the greater precision found in Linda Knutsonâ€™s Synthetic Dyes and Natural Fibers. </p></div>
