New York:Reinhold, 1935. 348 pp. Index, B/W illus., color illus. </p><p class="annot">Intended as a text, this book is divided into two major sections onwatercolor painting and architectural rendering. The first section presents lessons on watercolor technique, followed by information on color theory, color and light, characteristics of color, color mixing and matching, illusions and relativity, color harmony, and composition, all directed toward sketching outdoors and indoors. The section on architectural rendering applies the techniques and theoretical information from the first section to architecture and landscape. Seventy-two exercises, nearly 200 color plates, and many black-and-white illustrations contribute to the usefulness of the book, which, although dated, can still serve to supplement more current treatment of the subject. </p></div>
