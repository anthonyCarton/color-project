They also claim that Chevreul’s theories inspire their studio production, which includes Sonia Delaunay’s innovative designs for textiles. The book will appeal to those interested in the writings of artists who not only are serious about the role of color in painting and applied art in the early 20th century painting, but seem to receive their creative energy from color . </p></div>
