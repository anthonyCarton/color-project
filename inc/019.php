<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">19. Birren, Faber. The Story of Color. Westport, CT: Crimson, 1941. 338pp. Index, bibl., appendices, B/W illus.</p><p class="annot">This is Birrenâ€™s earliest comprehensive book on color. He reviews color in art, religion and mythology, healing, culture, astrology, alchemy, science, and psychology. The information included here has been expanded on in many of his later works, especially Color: A Survey in Words and Pictures of Color in Painting. Of particular interest are summaries of the work of influential scientists and colorists from Helmholtz to Munsell and Ostwald. Both text and appendices address color symbolism and color preference. Specific research mentioned in the text can be located in the 200-book bibliography. Despite its 1941 publication date, the broad range of topics covered makes this an exceptionally useful and interesting resource, especially for curiosities and color trivia.</p></div>
