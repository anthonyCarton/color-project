<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">137. Crewdson, Frederick M. Color in Decoration and Design. Wilmette, IL: Frederick J. Drake, 1953. 232 pp. Index, B/W illus., color illus. </p><p class="annot">The harmonious use of color in artistic, industrial, and commercialapplications is the stated goal of this book, though most of it is devoted to a broad overview of color science and theory. The author uses the psychologistâ€™s color circle because, he says, it most closely relates to colors observed in the spectrum. Color permanence, standardization, harmony, and contrast and the impact of illumination on color are also discussed. Only the last three chapters, which cover 40 pages actually address color use. Color-mixing formulas are provided for 250 hues. Although somewhat dated and entirely undocumented, this book contains many interesting facts and gives an overview of color in design in the early 1950s. </p></div>
