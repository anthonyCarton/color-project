ISBN 0-394- 7 1 7 13 - 9. </p><p class="annot">From historical, sociological, psychological, and anthropologicalviewpoints, Lurie examines the relationship between clothing and the wearerâ€™s gender, age, class, status, and opinions. The 30-page chapter on color and pattern focuses on the impact of color and the associations attached to the primary colors, secondary colors, black, white, and brown. Lurie also looks at the use of stripes, plaids, checks, dots, flowers, and words on clothing. This is a delightfully entertaining explanation of fashion choices as a reflection of the wearer. </p></div>
