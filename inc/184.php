New York:Dover, 1964. 274 pp. Index, endnotes/footnotes, B/W illus., color illus. </p><p class="annot">Color is approached from a painter’s viewpoint in this color classic.The author begins with an introduction to hue, value, intensity, scales, and hue circles. He then discusses and uses color problems to illustrate perceptual and traditional complements, simultaneous contrast, visual mix, and advancing and retreating qualities. Each discussion includes an exploration of a color topic, opportunities for experimentation by the reader and finally, questions to assess understanding. Sargent’s approach is interdisciplinary and ranges from the physics of color perception to the aesthetics of color in painting, is enhanced by material from the color literature. This corrected and revised version of the original 1923 edition uses the physical properties of color as a guide to a personal and subjective study of color. Sargent offers no new theories, but the analyses of color effects, the series of color experiments, and the examples from nature and art are all excellent. </p></div>
