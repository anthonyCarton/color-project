Tolland, CT: A Clinton, 1974. 184 pp. Index, B/W illus. </p><p class="annot">This informative and entertaining book by an author, known for herbooks on growing herbs, offers essays, plant lists, plot plans for eight gardens with special themes such as a garden of fragrance, a Shakespearean Garden, a garden of medicinal teas, and of special interest here, “Garden Tinctoria: Nature’s Dye Kit.” Each garden is described in a chapter that combines practical information with charming plant lore and legends that are associated with the herbs and flowers. Though there is no general discussion of color, the redeeming feature is the information on growing dye plants in one’s own garden, since most dye books emphasize dye methods. The plant list recommends 57 flowers, vegetables, herbs, and trees; gives brief directions for dyeing wool with various mordants and lists the resulting colors. </p></div>
