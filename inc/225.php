New York: Holt,Rinehart and Winston, 1961. 218 pp. Index, glossary, B/W illus </p><p class="annot">This college-level design foundations text provides interestingbackground information on design and perception as well as environmental material. Separate chapters examine natural and man-made design sources and analyze the elements of line, shape, form, texture, color, and motion. Four chapters include discussions of color fundamentals, symbolism as cultural source, and “color in action.”. While Anderson treats color in more detail than some basic design texts and provides many black-and-white illustrations, there are neither color illustrations nor references for further reading. The author states that his intent is to provide a flexible guide with discussion and motivating pictorial material rather than a rigid course of study. Some readers may feel that the somewhat confusing organization of this book -- for example, chapters on design sources alternate with chapters on design elements -- detracts from its usefulness. </p></div>
