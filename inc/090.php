The handsome plates, typography, and layout complement the well documented text which explains how the Munsell color system was modified for the British Standard and adapted to British needs, why additional hues were added, and other refinements. The color samples are published separately as color fans. The foreword by J. B. Dick points out the importance of the handbook as a document of color usage in architecture in the United Kingdom. </p></div>
