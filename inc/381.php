ISBN 0-316-798-452. </p><p class="annot">This handsome book introduces the language of color, color behavior, and other aspects of color in the context of interior design. Beautifully photographed interiors are organized around four major hue families, each with several values and chromas: yellows, reds, blues and greens, plus “neutrals” white, black, and brown. Each color family section features elegant European and American rooms, including rooms by well- known contemporary designers who employ a wide range of decorating styles and fabrics. Another section consists of examples of 10 different palettes such as earth colors, tropical colors, and palettes that suggest historic eras such as Victorian and Art Deco. An interesting concluding section on pigments, materials, and coloring matter depicts the surprising changes that occur when 20 frequently used pigments are gradually desaturated by white. Designers selecting wall colors or looking for inspiration will not be disappointed by this lavishly illustrated book. </p></div>
