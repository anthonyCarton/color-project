ISBN 0-295-95712-3. </p><p class="annot">This excellent introduction to visual design principles has culturaland visual literacy as its goal. Written in the spirit of Gyorgy Kepes’s Language of Vision, the author’s thoughtful yet experiential approach offers a line contrast to more conventional presentations of design basics. Eighteen chapters focus on conceptual problems such as form perception or color expression and provide students with exercises that build basic design skills, all the while weaving in rich excerpts of relevant readings from primary sources. Six “problem” chapters deal with color and cover the major theories, the Munsell color system, and approaches to color harmony. The impact of color on space and the use of color for coding, topics not often covered elsewhere, are addressed briefly. This comprehensive book offers interesting ideas for the teaching of color for instructors of three- dimensional design and architecture courses. An excellent bibliography includes audiovisual materials. This balance approach provides a successful model for design writers.</p></div>
