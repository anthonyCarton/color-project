Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall, 1986. 322 pp. Index, bibl., glossary, B/W illus., color illus. </p><p class="annot">“Fundamentals of communicating through graphics in print” for students, teachers, supervisors, and professionals in graphic design, publications editing or printing are brought together in this handsomely designed, highly readable, and comprehensive work. The author surveys the history and nature of graphic communication, the design process, typographic images, typography, text preparation, graphic images, processing text and image, publications design, and production. An unusual section on business practices in industry discusses the procedures and attitudes of printers and professionals. The concise color chapter that rounds out the book shows a conventional 12-hue circle, explains additive and subtractive primaries, and surveys many color technology topics such as types of color printing, the Pantone® system, color separation by scanner, and color proofing. Eight pages of excellent captioned color plates, and fine black-and-white information graphics or photographs on most pages make this an exceptionally striking reference. For information on the impact of newspaper color on the reader will need to refer to the work of Mario Garcia and Pegie Stark. </p></div>
