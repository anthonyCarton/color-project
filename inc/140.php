<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">140. Gatto, Joseph. Color and Value. Worcester, MA: Davis, 1974. 80 pp. Index, B/W illus., color illus. ISBN 0-8'll92-O65-4. </p><p class="annot">All of the photographs in this generously illustrated and easy-to- readwork are by its author, an art educator. Most pages show several excellent examples of value found in the creative work of architects, craftworkers, artists, industrial designers, sculptors, and photographers. The text and captions discuss many color concepts including characteristics of color and of value, factors affecting them, and how color affects visual communication. The text offers a good introduction to the subject for thenovice or for the instructor looking for a way to organize this content. Unfortunately, the quality of the printing makes the book seem dated, and although the author writes about color qualities very well, the only color that appears is in the 20-page color plate section bound in the bookâ€™s center. </p></div>
