ISBN 0-442-29985-0. </p><p class="annot">Drawing from his background in engineering and color reproductiontechnology, Kuepper’s intent is to systematically integrate information from the vast field of theory. Discussions of the nature of color in general, color in the environment ,and color and language, and physiology, are followed by a physical and technical section. Topics include electromagnetic vibrations, the light spectrum, color temperature, color saturation, and measurement of color density. A well-illustrated review of color systems explores primary colors and the color circle, complementary colors, additive and subtractive mixtures, and finally such color systems and color solids as Hickethier, Ostwald, CIE, DIN 61 64, and the Kueppers rhombohedron. “Points to Remember,” the final eight-page section provides (in the absence of an index) a highly useful summary of all important ideas presented. While this work emphasizes color technology, Kuepper’s fine books include The Basic Law of Color Theory (1982), which is a color primer with an “understandable color theory based on scientifically supported fact ” for teachers and color educators, and Color Atlas: A Practical Guide to Color Mixing (1982), a color specification guide for four color printing. </p></div>
