ISBN 0-394-72467-4. </p><p class="annot">While this comprehensive book thoroughly covers the technology of camera equipment, films, color printing, and the art of picture taking, it also contains chapters on the history of color photography and the language of color. To develop color awareness and explain color relationships beyond a color circle, the authors introduce ten categories of color effects. These include strong color, muted color, high- and low-key color, color contrast, color harmony in nature and predominant color. Each category is explained in two facing pages with text and photographs by many leading photographers that teach by example. Photographs or instructive diagrams appear on every page of this friendly text which is packed with suggestions and guidelines for practical application. </p></div>
