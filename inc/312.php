The chapter on dyeing covers natural and synthetic dyes and provides recipes and instructions. The “Design and Color” chapter discusses a design process that begins with setting limitations and applying design principles. Then color theory is covered briefly. The breadth of this book is both an advantage and a disadvantage, because each topic is not addressed in detail. An extensive chapter catalog suppliers of both materials and equipment. </p></div>
