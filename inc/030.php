New Hyde Park, NY: University Books, 1967. 271 pp. B/W illus., color illus.</p><p class="annot">Originally published in 1878, this work, Birren contends, was seminal in the field of color therapy. Babbit’s ideas differed radically from accepted scientific thought of his time. Although his theories about the beneficial health effects of color and light created a furor in medical circles, his assertions of the healing power of substances based solely on their color led some people to call him a miracle man. While the validity of Babbit’s theories is questionable, Birren points out that the scientific community has in more recent times come to recognize the relationship between environment, including color and light, and a sense of physical or emotional well-being.</p></div>
