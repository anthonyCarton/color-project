<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">480. Sacharow, Stanley. The Package as a Marketing Tool. Radnor, PA: Chilton, 1982. 206 pp. Index, B/W illus. ISBN 0-8019-6954-9. </p><p class="annot">The author starts with the premise that the package itself is a product and that successful packaging results in increased sales. The range of topics includes American consumer demographics, planning and executing successful packaging, advertising, test-marketing, packaging economics, brand names, consumerism, trends, and history of packaging. Discussion of color, color associations, and symbolism is confined to a skimpy three- page section. While there is no bibliography, reference is made to Favre’s Color Sells Your Package, and to Cheskin’s Color for Profit, Color Guide for Marketing Media, and How to Predict What People Will Buy. </p></div>
