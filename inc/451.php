<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib special">451. Borgeson, Bet. The Colored Pencil. New York: Watson-Guptil, 1983. 142 pp. Index, B/W illus., color illus. ISBN 0-8230-0742-1. </p><p class="annot">The author’s coloristic approach to drawing is the basis for this book. A broad range of examples, including interior design renderings and portraits, shows how he creates structure with color. Color is seen as playing an essential role in the drawing process from the onset, rather than being treated as added decoration. Instructive discussions of hue circles, value and texture scales, and color relativity distinguish this book from technical manuals. The author’s careful attention to details extends to providing instruction on archival matting and framing methods as well as a survey of materials and equipment. </p></div>
