ISBN: 0-442-28603-1. </p><p class="annot">This account of how “graphic techniques and color sense can besystematically developed in children thirteen through sixteen,” is written for instructors. A third of the book provides color instruction in 41 two-page lesson units. The first page presents educational aims, goals in pictorial design and analytical thinking, aesthetic judgment for each lesson, and examples for study of art appreciation. Illustrations of student work based on the lesson appear on the opposite page. Tools, various art materials and processes including embroidery, stained glass, and weaving, nature studies, color and decoration, and subjective color are some of the topics. Basic color exercises follow the tenets of Johannes Itten, who is cited, while other abstract lessons focus on color composition, proportion, and placement. The student examples compare favorably with work by college-age students at the Basel Art School shown in Basic Principles of Design by Manfred Maier. Both Tritten and Maier convey the spirit of Swiss education in art. </p></div>
