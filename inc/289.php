<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">289. Denton, Susan and Barbara Macey. Quiltmaking. New York: Sterling, 1988. 176 pp. Index, bibl., glossary, B/W illus., color illus. ISBN 0- 8069-6870-2. </p><p class="annot">First published in Australia, this book provides a thoroughintroduction to quiltmaking, using both traditional designs and new variations. The organization is logical, starting with materials and equipment and progressing through chapters on color, construction and finishing techniques, and design methods. Considerable attention is given to Seminole, Log-Cabin, Crazy Patch, and Australian Wagga quilts. While the 10-page chapter on color is not thorough, it covers the conventional color harmonies and focuses most on color relativity, including special color effects. It suggests some strategies for color use and eight exercises provide opportunities for experimentation. Although far from comprehensive, the practical information and relevant illustrations could provide the quiltmaker with new insights into color use. </p></div>
