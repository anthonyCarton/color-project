<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib special">348. Kasprisin, Ronald I. Watercolor in Architectural Design. NewYork: Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1989. 268 pp. Index, appendix, B/W illus., color illus. ISBN 0-442-22925-9. </p><p class="annot">The author’s credo is that color is a “dynamic design tool, an energyor force in motion, that should be an integral part of the design process from inception to completion, not an afterthought of applied color,” and he sees watercolor as an important medium for design communication. He provides well-illustrated and clearly explained treatments of the nature of color and light, color relationships, the Munsell system, pigments and mixing colors, and various hue circles that may be mixed from pigments. The delightful color interaction section is illustrated by simple house shapes, with doors in contrasting colors, in place of the usual nested squares used for color exercises. Technical problems of special interest to students are neatly organized by description, objective, strategy, sequence, and technique. The author’s process for diagramming ideas is shown in a chapter on preliminary studies. Descriptions of his painting methods accompany the watercolors, which vary from quick proposals to sophisticated watercolor renderings. This carefully grounded and documented text also covers safety in the workplace. </p></div>
