Color in Modem Packaging: Being a Sprightly Discussion of Color Harmony Principles Rather Than Laws That Affect the Efforts of Packaging Artists. Chicago: Crimson, I935. 30 pp. Index, B/W illus. </p><p class="annot">In regard to package design, Birren believes that the ability to attract attention and make an emotional appeal is more important than purely aesthetic concerns. In an authoritative manner, he states that color art for packaging can be limited to a palette of 480 colors and provides rules for color use. He argues against the use of visually balanced complements because they have conflicting psychological qualities, e.g. hot/cold and aggressive/passive. As an alternative, he suggests “off-balance” or near complements and analogous colors, and proposes other color harmonies based on the Ostwald color system. Those who know Birren’s work will find this book a curiosity, reflecting his early views on color usage. Both his approach and his ideas changed in his later work, where he adopted Ostwald’s color order as his own. </p></div>
