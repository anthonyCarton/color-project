In his excellent chapter on color, Aaron Marcus states that many people without color theory expertise are now using color in their computer work. Arguing for informed use of color that aids communication, he discusses basic color theory with an emphasis on the Munsell color system, makes recommendations for hue, value, and chroma selection, and discusses the creation of compositions through the use of contrast, harmony, and rhythm. Although some of the information is likely to become dated quickly, the excellent Marcus chapter presents enduring color principles. </p></div>
