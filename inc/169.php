B/W illus, color illus. </p><p class="annot">This original limited edition consists of a text volume that describescolor relativity experiments developed in Albers’s color course, a collection of loose silk-screened folders showing 150 large color studies by Albers and his students, and a volume with commentary on the color studies, all in a large 10 1/2 by 14 inch format designed by Norman Ives. Albers’s innovative method replaces traditional pigment-based color theory and paint exercises with first-hand observation of color interaction and experiments with prepared colored papers. The text offers deceptively brief essays on 25 color studies including illusions of transparency, middle mixture, vibrating and vanishing boundaries, fluting, afterimage, the Weber-Fechner law, and the Bezold effect. Since Albers rarely states a clear definition, the reader is left to draw conclusions from musical analogies and the experiments, which is the author’s intent. Albers offers some views of color science and proposes a perceptual or afterimage basis for complementary color pairs. For commentary on Albers’s interpretation of color science see Vitz and Glimcher, Modem Art and Modem Science (27). Absence of an index is a drawback. Nonetheless, this monumental work on color relativity has won wide acceptance among educators, especially after the appearance of the inexpensive paper back edition (see 178). </p></div>
