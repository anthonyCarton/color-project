Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1981. 212 pp. Index, bibl., glossary, B/W illus. ISBN 0-13-647834-4. </p><p class="annot">This book gives a good introduction to the field of package and container design and provides general information on the design process, materials and techniques available to the designer, and the environmental implications of packaging. Each of the nine clearly written and well illustrated chapters includes a reading list and projects for students. However attention to color in packaging is restricted to a very limited five- page color chapter, the recommended readings consist only of Ittenâ€™s Art of Color and a 1940 text on advertising, and, worse, there are no color illustrations. </p></div>
