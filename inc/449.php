ISBN 0-87701-345-4. </p><p class="annot">This second guide in a series features more complicated printed color combinations. Following a very brief introduction to color theory, the book consists of pages of small samples of 90 basic colors in more than 1,000 combinations categorized according to qualities described as bright, brilliant, medium, dark, subdued, concentrated, and clear. CMYK formulas for all the colors are given. In contrast to the “basic and clinical” approach of the first guide, here the author explores “emotional and personal” aspects of color in captions that are subjective and sometimes vague. Like the first in the series, this book is based on Haishoku Jiten by I. Shibukawa and Y. Takahashi.</p></div>
