ISBN 0-O3-030422-9. </p><p class="annot">This introduction to design basics offers 13 well-organized modularchapters. The 31-page color chapter is well illustrated with instructive diagrams and mainly 20th-century paintings. Included are discussions of properties of color, optical color mixing, the spreading effect, warm/cool contrast, basic color schemes and harmonies, color discord, and color meaning and symbolism. Considerable emphasis is placed on the “value” characteristic of color. The author discusses color applications and examples using design concepts and vocabulary presented earlier in the book. Although information is presented briefly, this book provides an excellent introduction to color within a general design context. </p></div>
