<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">231. De Sausmarez, Maurice. Basic Design: The Dynamics of Visual Form. London: Studio Vista, 1964. 96 pp. B/W illus., color illus. </p><p class="annot">This writer discusses design process, enumerates and illustratessome elements of design, and shares Kepes’s Gestalt inspired view of visual forces. The chapters on the two-dimensional field, spatial forces, and analytical drawing are mainly illustrated with black-and-white examples of student work. Two brief chapters on color deal with the constructive aspect of color and the energy or inner force of color, which Itten calls the contrast of extension.. The first presents a 12-hue circle, black-and-white diagrams for students to fill in, and a discussion of objective principles. Color space and subjective color are treated in the second chapter along with a list of' nine color contrasts reminiscent of Itten’s seven contrasts. Except for its value as a record of English foundations courses in the 1960s, the information and the limited illustrations pale in comparison to the many more comprehensive and detailed basic texts now available. </p></div>
