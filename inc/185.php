<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">185. Sidelinger, Stephen J. Color Manual. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall, 1985. 122 pp. Bibl., B/W illus., color illus. ISBN 0-13-152041-5. </p><p class="annot">This text for students surveys many color concepts: Munsell’s threecolor dimensions of hue, value, and chroma; afterimages; complementary, warm and cool, and simultaneous contrasts; physiology; proportion; and color harmonies such as triads and tetrads. Occasionally, the book’s organization is illogical and there are some inaccuracies, such as the attribution of color proportion ratios to Goethe. This eclectic book is a popularization and summarization of theories expressed by Munsell, Itten, and Albers. The final quarter of the book deals with “universal psychological color associations” which though interesting, are undocumented. Among the useful features are the color illustrations and a complete set of Munsell Student Charts. </p></div>
