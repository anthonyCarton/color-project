<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib special">468. Tufte, Edward R. Envisioning Information. Cheshire, CT: Graphics Press, 1990. 166 pp. Index, B/W illus., color illus. ISBN 0- 9613921-1-8. </p><p class="annot">In this new classic on information design, the author shows ways to escape what he calls the “flatland” of two-dimensional paper and the computer screen in six eloquent chapters on micro/macro readings, layering and separation, small multiples, color and information, and narratives of space and time. The concise text is generously illustrated with historic and contemporary examples from around the world, including maps, charts, tables, graphs and diagrams. Captioned marginal illustrations on every page enrich and augment the text which compiles and integrates important references from the field. The color chapter distills information from Eduard Imhof’s Cartographic Relief Presentation, Berlin 1982, and others. The eloquent text, the careful documentation , and the handsome graphic design all reflect Tufte’s intelligent guidelines for information design. Though examples of unsuccessful information design are used when needed to make a point, nothing distracts from the flow of the clearly written text and the beautiful illustrations. This is a superb example of unified design image, and text. </p></div>
