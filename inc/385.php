<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">385. Wilson, Jose, and Arthur Leaman. Color in Decoration and Design. New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1971. 159 pp. Bibl., glossary, color illus. </p><p class="annot">In an interesting chapter on color theory, the authors summarize the contributions or innovations of 18 professionals selected from several design fields. Other chapters demonstrate the use of lighting, show options for color on building exteriors, and give an overview of historically inspired interiors. The color photographs, credited to Antiques, House and Garden, House Beautiful, Interiors, InteriorDesign, and other magazines, capture the bright palette typical of the 1960s. Faber Birrenâ€™s introduction especially commends the comprehensive and well-illustrated glossary, which makes up one third of the book. </p></div>
