This phenomenon is further discussed as it can be seen among fish, birds, and insects. The section on “The Anatomy of Structural Colors” presents clear and detailed information on the physical and scientific sources of color in general and iridescent hues in particular. Color vision in the animal kingdom is compared with human color vision. Handsome color drawings by the author supplement the informative and entertaining text. </p></div>
