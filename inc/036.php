Directions are given for selecting the single most liked color and single most disliked color out of 23 provided samples and for grouping four colors together, along with fascinating interpretive material related to personality. By comparison, the reader ranks eight colors singly according to personal preference in the better known Liischer color test (1948). The serious student of color psychology will want to examine a 1 more typical Friehling work such as Das Gesetz der Farbe (1979), which has a broad scope and an extensive bibliography that reviews the international color literature.</p></div>
