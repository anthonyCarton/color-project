Exchange Bibliography #105 1. 9 pp.</p><p class="annot">This 60-item bibliography contains book and journal citations for works dealing with psychological and physiological response to light. The author notes that planners and designers must be aware of research in this area because lighting significantly affects the user. Most of the entries were published in the 1960s. Many of the titles appear to deal only with light and not with color, but without annotations it is not possible to make a determination.</p></div>
