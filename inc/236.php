<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">236. Hageney, Wolfgang, ed. Design and Light: Three - Dimensional Color Effects and Patterns in Abstract Design: Designer’s Notebook 28. Rome: Belvedere, 1988. 96 pp. ISBN 88-7070-063-1 </p><p class="annot">This guide to pattern design demonstrates how to use the “object andits shadow and then lose the identities of the two with overlays or superimpositions together with intervening spaces, creating a full page of a field pattern.” Pattern motifs for a full page of patterns are based on the shapes and cast shadows of ordinary manufactured objects such as an ink bottle, lamp bulb, electric iron, and woman’s shoe. Each pattern is shown in a series: first as a line drawing; in flat value with three grays and black; in three grays and black; and in alternative color ways accompanied by CYMK percentages for matching in printing inks. Seventeen pages scattered through the text (which is given in English, Italian, German, Spanish and French) explain the method. Although this seems to intended for the beginning designers and the quality of the color printing is mediocre, the repeat patterns may interest surface designers and textile artists. </p></div>
