Colour Science: A Handbook for Advanced Students in Schools, Colleges, and the Various Arts, Crafts, and Industries Depending on the Use of Color. Translated by J. Scott Taylor. London: Winsor & Newton, 1931. Vol. 1, 141 pp.; Vol. 2, 173 pp. B/W illus., color illus. </p><p class="annot">In the first volume a compact history of color theory is followed bychapters on light and vision, a thorough discussion of how Ostwald developed his system, and a detailed description of that system. The second volume reviews color measurement, the physiochemical aspects of color, color mixing and pigments, psychophysical aspects such as meaning and harmony, and then concludes with a colored Ostwald 24-hue circle. Although this valuable primary source contains much more information, many readers will find Basic Color by Egbert Jacobson an easier introduction to the basics of the complex Ostwald system. </p></div>
