The Art of Color and Design. 2nd ed.New York:McGraw Hill, 1951. 439 pp. Index, endnotes/footnotes, glossary, B/W illus., color illus. </p><p class="annot">This revision and expansion of the 1941 edition of the same titlepresents a course of study for the beginning student based on the design elements of line, direction, shape, size, texture, value, and color. The section on color, based on Munsell, includes a “color chord” method for creating unified color schemes. Only brief references are made to the use of color in interiors and in art. The author explains his unstandardized “Graves Design Judgment Test,” which illustrates design principles that he claims are as basic and natural as balance or gravity, and also briefly describes the standardized version of the test, which he devised to measure aptitude for appreciation or production of art. While the datedness of the content and the illustrations limit the usefulness of this book, it presents an interesting record of the author’s approach to teaching design and color in the 1940s and his work on art aptitude. </p></div>
