Chicago: Crimson, 1934. 57 pp. B/W illus., color illus. </p><p class="annot">Birren approaches color as sensation and attempts to explain inpsychological terms that the art of color is about a personal response of the eye and mind rather than about instruments, charts, and scales. He explains the Maxwell wheel and the Munsell and Ostwald systems. A revision of the Ostwald system that incorporates the “natural” value of colors is presented as the “Rational Color Circle,” with 13 hues and nine value steps, which places gray not in the center of the hue circle but closer to the blue side. Birren enumerates six dimensions of harmony based on his revision. He also summarizes basic color theories, traditional color harmonies, and color in history and nature. This is a unique title among Birren’s many books because it describes in detail a color system that he abandoned in his later writings. </p></div>
