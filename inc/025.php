<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">25. Valentine, Charles Wilfred. The Experimental Psychology of Beauty. London: Methuen, 1962. 438 pp. Index, endnotes/footnotes, B/W illus.</p><p class="annot">Valentine brings together the results of a variety of experiments and studies that deal with the reaction of people of many types and ages to that which is said to be beautiful. He looks not only at color and design elements but also at art objects, music, and poetry. Two chapters summarize the results of research mainly from the first third of the 20th century on preferences and attitudes toward colors and color combinations, which are affected by environment, fashion, the intended use of the color or object, and many other factors. The variety of results and inconsistency between studies point to the need for more careful control of variables in future research. Although dated, this book is recommended as an overview of early research on color preference.</p></div>
