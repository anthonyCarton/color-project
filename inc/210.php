<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">210. Girard, Robert. Color and Composition: A Guide for Artists. New York: Reinhold, 1974. 100 pp. Index, bibl., B/W illus., color illus. ISBN 0- 442-30030-1. </p><p class="annot">The author believes that artists can realize their own personalexpression only if they have a clear understanding and working knowledge of technique and the concepts of color, form, and harmony. Consequently, this book is intended as a guide to assist in discovery and analysis. Material on color theory is so brief that it is sometimes unclear. Nevertheless, the inclusion of information on geometry and aesthetics as they relate to art and design, combined with excellent illustrations, makes this a potentially useful “idea book” for the reader who already has a good working knowledge of color and design. </p></div>
