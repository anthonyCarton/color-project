ISBN 1-85223-199-1. </p><p class="annot">The author points to shape, form, color, and perfume as the fourfactors contributed by plants as he explains the steps in the garden design process. His brief discussion of fundamental color theory includes primary and secondary hues and psychological effects of color. He introduces methods for creating depth illusions through color placement and encourages the reader to try for color interest throughout the year. This informative book also presents a concise history and social view of English gardens, surveys gardening styles, and provides plant lists for prolonged or particular color that include flowering and foliage plants, vegetables, fruits and herbs. The fine balance between design and color is reflected in the exceptional illustrations which present birdseye-views of garden plans as abstract quilts embroidered with Pointillist textures. Imaginative illustrations or diagrams on every page enhance the clearly written text. </p></div>
