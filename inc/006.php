ISBN 0- 85072- 091- 5.</p><p class="annot">This unannotated bibliography of books and articles concentrates on British design history. While not comprehensive, the impressive range of subjects includes design education; organizations and institutions; design theory, studies, trends, and practitioners; and graphic, interior, furniture, costume, and industrial design. The eight -page chapter on color, ornament, and pattern lists approximately 50 titles on color theory and application. Coulson introduces groupings of books and articles with brief descriptive and evaluative information, making this a unique resource that is part listing and part literature review.</p></div>
