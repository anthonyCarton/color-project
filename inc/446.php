Each book follows precisely the same format and can be enjoyed individually. However, the entire set provides a practical tool that includes but goes well beyond the mechanics of specifying color for process printing. The five volumes comprise a reference system to 125 selected colors, with 400 type possibilities, 1,000 half-tone options, and 1,500 color combinations on tinted stock, on constant color charts, as color ways, as backdrops, as conveyers of image content, and in designs that combine several colors. Each of the basic colors is shown in consistent patterns, as type on various background tints, and in duo-tone and tri-tone. Outstanding examples of the work of leading international graphic designers illustrate concise discussions of how the colors can be affected by optical illusions; proportion and texture changes; psychological associations; cultural and period influences; and color as a marketing tool. The author and book production team of 16 editors and designers have created a beautifully illustrated and informative series that is superbly printed in Hong Kong. Colorworks 1: The Red Book presents a spectrum of 25 reds, magentas, purples, and oranges. Colorworks 2: The Blue Book features 25 blues, purples, and cyan greens. Colorworks 3: The Yellow Book shows 25 yellow derived colors, including greens and browns. Colorworks 4: The Pastels Book offers an entire spectrum from yellow, through pink, purple, blue and green at the pastel level, including subtle grayed tints. Eight of the colors featured in Colorworks 5: The Black and White Book are grays based on increasing percentages of black while the rest consist of the same black percentages with low percentages of yellow or magenta or cyan added; thus its 25 “colors” cover an entire spectrum from yellow, through pink, purple, blue and green at tint or pastel level, including subtle grayed tints. The only shortcoming is the lack of explanation of the rationale for selecting the basic hues for each book, and for determining the color names. </p></div>
