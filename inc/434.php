Color In The 21st Century: A Practical Guide for Graphic Designers, Photographers, Printers, Separators, and Anyone Involved in Color Printing. New York: Watson-Guptill, 1991. Index, B/W illus., color illus. ISBN 0-8230-0743-X. </p><p class="annot">This practical guide to recent color reproduction technology briefly introduces color as light, the visible spectrum, additive primaries, and subtractive primaries. Much more in-depth treatment is given to a comparison of ideal and typical ink colors, the deficiencies of printing inks, and color correction in the printing process. Curiously, a 12 hue circle is used to illustrate the discussion of a ten section color wheel; and in the brief discussion of subjective color the “adjacency effect” is used to describe what is universally called “simultaneous contrast.” Other topics include printing in color, saving money in color printing, evaluating color proofs, printing a four color job, and desktop computers and color production.</p></div>
