Batsford, 1933. 87 Index, color illus. </p><p class="annot">The first edition of this work appeared in 1915, at the close ofCarpenter’s long career as headmaster of an English art school. Ogden Rood’s table of the natural order of colors is acknowledged as the cornerstone of Carpenter’s approach. Basic color studies and guidelines for practice intended to form the foundation of a color course for painters, decorators, and textile artists, are well illustrated by color plates of abstract color patterns that anticipate the Albers’ color relativity studies. Fine plates, careful organization, and lucid explanations by a master teacher enrich this color design treasure. </p></div>
