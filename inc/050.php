Prang, 1876. 274 pp. Index, bibl., B/W illus., color illus. </p><p class="annot">Bezold’s clear explanations of the physical basis of color and light,the spectrum, color contrasts, and application of color theories make this a very readable classic that addresses the concerns of artists. The discussion of the nature of color also covers colorants, fiber and other materials, organizing and mixing colors, and successive and simultaneous contrasts. The final chapter applies theories of color balance to practice in decorative arts and painting. The “Bezold effect” has been brought to the attention of modem audiences in publications by many color authorities including Josef Albers and Ralph Evans. </p></div>
