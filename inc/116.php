Washington: National Gallery of Art, 1986. 300 pp. ISBN 0521303745. </p><p class="annot">Ten artists’ pigments that are highly important in the history of painting are the focus of this encyclopedic and well-documented publication with a preface by J. Carter Brown. What is rare is that both scientific and historic aspects are brought together in the ten monographs contributed by 17 scholars. Organized to be useful to readers with a broad range of interests in artists pigments, this group of monographs systematically covers the nomenclature and general character of each pigment, the history of its use, matters of concern to the artist, its chemical and physical composition, technical methods and procedures used to characterize and identify the pigment, and significant references to its use by a particular artist or in a specific work. It will also be useful to those researching hiding power, toxicity and compatibility of pigments. </p></div>
