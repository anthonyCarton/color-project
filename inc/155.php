Leonardoâ€™s theory of colors appears in the first volume where he records his firsthand observations of color appearance in the environment and how to contrast colors in painting. His knowledge of color relativity is suggested in descriptions of color contrasts and especially in his guidelines for selecting colors and backgrounds on the basis of how vivid or intense they appear to the viewer. Other topics include the reflection of colors, the use of dark and light colors, colors of the rainbow, colored shadows, and rules for color in aerial perspective in painting. </p></div>
