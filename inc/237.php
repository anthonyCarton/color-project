New York: Watson-Guptill, 1972. 301 pp. Index, bibl., B/W illus., color illus ISBN 0-8230-0049-4. </p><p class="annot">The author’s wonderfully fresh viewpoint shows the reader art anddesign elements of line, form, mass, shape, pattern, space, and color can relate to or derive from natural sources, structures and phenomena. The author’s program for study of natural forces such as weather and atmosphere, patterns in living creatures and earth forms, and lines of growth and erosion offers a fascinating source of design ideas and projects for students. The many illustrations, dramatic photographs, and works by artists including Leonardo da Vinci and Albrecht Diirer are well integrated into the text. In keeping with Hale’s focus on human perception of color, the color chapter contains interesting descriptions of “inner color” and illustrations of afterimage experiments. </p></div>
