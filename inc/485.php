ISBN 0-8094- 4152- 7. </p><p class="annot">Explanations of the new tools and techniques that appeared in the decade following the original 1970 edition are linked to the near monopoly of color photography in family and fashion pictures, nature photography, and photojournalism. How color film works, the history of the search for a color process, light sources, film and filters, and achieving desired color effects are thoroughly covered. A superb overview of innovators in color photography documents the nature, fashion, and news photography of Irving Penn, Eliot Porter, Ernst Haas, and Larry Burrows. Techniques are given for photographing works of art. The chapter on tools and techniques gives detailed step-by-step illustrated instructions for home processing. </p></div>
