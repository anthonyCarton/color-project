ISBN 0-87220-040-X. </p><p class="annot">Writing from the viewpoint of a philosopher attracted to colorscience, Hardin sketches out some of the scientific facts from the literature of color vision since the 1950s and provides access to relevant and important scientific material on color in this highly acclaimed reference. He encourages other philosophers to “come to grips with relevant scientific material‚” and to inform their own writings on color with knowledge. Major sections on color perception and science, the ontology of color, and the phenomenology and physiology of color will challenge the the non- specialist. However, the dedicated reader will find it convenient to have a reliable overview of hitherto scattered material in one well-documented and carefully written reference. </p></div>
