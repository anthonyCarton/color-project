<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib special">150. Hope, Augustine and Margaret Walch. The Color Compendium. New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1989. 384 pp. Index, bibl., B/W illus, color illus. ISBN 0-442-31845. </p><p class="annot">This comprehensive, handsomely illustrated color encyclopedia anddictionary contains 1,100 entries on a wonderful array of topics, including color psychology, optics, perception, color and human behavior, color in advertising, gem colors, color symbolism, current color research, and color in graphic communication. Thirty essays by a team of experts discuss such matters as color in architecture and the environment, fashion, and historical color systems. The value of this book is enhanced even more by its consolidation of much hitherto scattered information, for example: a list of 66 color specifier systems from The Faber Birren Collection of Books on Color at Yale; 30 historic color palettes from Margaret Walchâ€™s Color Source Book; and an unannotated bibliography with over 460 titles. Margaret Walch serves as director of the Color Association of the United States. </p></div>
