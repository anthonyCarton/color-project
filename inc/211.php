ISBN 0-442-20181-8. </p><p class="annot">This book on color in painting begins with a short account of colorscience and theory, which Guptill contends provide a relevant foundation for the painter. Explanations of visual phenomena include a summary of Chevreulâ€™s laws of simultaneous contrast. The author suggests color harmonies based on traditional monochromatic, analogous, achromatic, complementary, and triadic relationships. A chapter on pigments offers specific palettes for oil painters and watercolorists and discusses the characteristics of the recommended hues. Sixty-two exercises on mixing a color wheel, bridging complements, and creating color scales, encourage experimentation with tools, pigments, and techniques for both watercolor and oils. Even those who are not interested in oil or watercolor could learn about color with this clearly written manual. </p></div>
