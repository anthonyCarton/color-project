At the book’s beginning the reader is introduced to the basic facts and numerous technicalities of proof-checking four color printing: sending material to the color house, originals for reproduction, reproduction techniques, and printing processes. Another section explains and demonstrates in great detail all about proofs, the different methods of proofing, and the work of the color separation house. Then the intricacies of the step-by-step process of checking proofs are revealed through colored plates, diagrams, and explanations on every page. Many examples of what can go wrong and how to make color corrections are shown. The availability of this work and its use as a handy color proofing guide should enable designers to achieve much better results and, ultimately, to set higher standards for color printing.432. </p></div>
