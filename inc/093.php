Washington, DC: National Bureau of Standards, 1965. 20 pp. Color illus. </p><p class="annot">This chart is an essential supplement to NBS Circular 553, The ISCC -NBS Method of Designating Colors and a Dictionary of Color Names (1965) by Kenneth Kelly and Deane Judd. The brief introductory information includes a chronology of the color-name project from 1921 to 1958 and the ISCC-NBS color designators and Munsell re-notations for the color chips as approximations of the Centroid colors. The chart consists of 267 color chips organized into 18 hue families by value and chroma. Chips for each hue family are mounted on a separate page that grades from light to dark gray, so that colors appear on a background of related lightness. </p></div>
