His discourse on specific art and design subjects such as color, visual organization, and his less well known approach to drawing emphasizes first-hand experience. Seven pages of color plates provide an opportunity for readers to experience some of the characteristics of color he describes. Readers interested in more complete information about Albersâ€™ approach to the study and teaching of color should see his Interaction of Color. </p></div>
