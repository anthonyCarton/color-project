ISBN 0-442-24044-9. </p><p class="annot">This book records the basic foundation course Itten introduced at theBauhaus in 1919 and the work of his students in that course. Nine sections, each supported by a page or two of discussion and many illustrations, depict light-dark, color, material and texture, form, rhythm, expressive forms, and subjective forms. Most of the illustrations of student work are accompanied by brief explanatory captions. The color section is limited to a presentation of Itten’s much copied 12-hue circle and summaries of his seven color contrasts. Not intended as a course of study for students, this book is more useful to instructors or those interested in Itten’s concepts. Itten’s color ideas and student exercises are fully covered in his comprehensive Art of Color (1961.) </p></div>
