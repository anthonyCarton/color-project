<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">365. Alexander, Harold R. Design: Criteria for Decisions. New York: Macmillan, 1976. 556 pp. Index, B/W illus., color illus. ISBN 0-02- 30 l 6604-4. </p><p class="annot">This introduction to design addresses both aesthetic and functional aspects of design and thoroughly covers design principles and elements in the first 60 pages. The chapter on color summarizes color and light, presents the 12-hue circle, explains three attributes of color, discusses color harmonies, and lists common associations or symbolism for primary and secondary hues and black and white. A strength of this well-illustrated text is its unusually broad scope and comprehensive coverage of important issues for interior design, housing, and environmental design students, whether in lecture courses or studio courses. The treatment of theoretical and historic aspects of environmental design includes city planning, the interior environment, architectural design, and furniture design. </p></div>
