<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">68. Evans, Ralph Merrill. An Introduction to Color. New York: Wiley, 1948.340 pp. Index, bibl., endnotes/footnotes, B/W illus., color illus. </p><p class="annot">Here is a clearly written overview of the effects of the “properties ofcolored light, the properties of vision, and the action of the mind in interpreting color,” offered by the long-time head of the Color Control Department for Eastman Kodak Company. He discusses the physical, physiological, and psychological aspects of color and covers pigments and color application in photography, art and design. The level of explanation presupposes no more than an elementary understanding of physics or psychology. Although the illustrations are dated, this non-mathematical presentation can still be recommended as a useful resource. The author’s Perception of Color (1974) reports his new findings and revised ideas about color perception. </p></div>
