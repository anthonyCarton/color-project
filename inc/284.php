ISBN 0-446-87672-0. </p><p class="annot">This author of books on dressing for success for men states thatmost women dress for failure because they are unduly influenced by fashion, socioeconomic background, and perception of themselves as sexual objects. He recommends “wardrobe engineering” to achieve a more satisfactory response from clients, coworkers, and supervisors. This includes both style of clothing and accessories and optimum color choices for “power” clothing. Molloy claims that his authoritative advice is based on scientific research but does not reveal his data or sources. This book aims at the general rather than the academic/scholarly reader, which may explain but does not excuse the absence of documentation. Carleton Wagner addresses the color aspect of the same issues in his books, but Molloy is more thorough and more convincing. </p></div>
