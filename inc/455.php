<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib special">455. Doyle, Michael E. Color Drawing: A Marker/Colored Pencil Approach for Architects, Landscape Architects, Interior and Graphic Designers, and Artists. New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1980. 320 pp. Index, bibl., glossary, color illus. ISBN 0-442- 22 l 84-3. </p><p class="annot">The author, a design educator, offers a broad framework for learning to make informed design decisions based on an understanding of color fundamentals, color harmony, and composing with color. He intersperses discussions of these basic color topics with practical instructions for creating color effects through an optical mixture technique that layers markers and colored pencils. Several drawing portfolio sections include compositions that depict a range of architectural materials in interior and exterior contexts. The Munsell-based color harmony section, approximately a fifth of the book, is augmented by an index of 20 full-page Munsell hue charts that show some color equivalents in marker and colored pencil. While afterimage is described as the basis for Munsell opposites, simultaneous contrast and interaction of colors are not covered. Color “schemes” and harmony through dominance, contrast, and repetition are well illustrated and explained with frequent quotes from Itten’s The Art of Color. Students who use this guide as the author intended should become much more aware of foundational color concepts as they strive for technical proficiency. </p></div>
