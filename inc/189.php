ISBN 0-8176-3253-0. </p><p class="annot">Swinoff moves beyond the two dimensional color investigations ofher teacher, Josef Albers. Her main concern is with the interaction of color with light, form, and surface in three-dimensional space. The theoretical background section summaries include the contributions of Ewald Hering, Max Wertheimer, James J. Gibson, Edwin Land, and artist-colorists Josef Albers and Georges Seurat. Subsequent sections show experiments using abstract three-dimensional forms that evoke the spatiality of color. Other topics explored are the interaction of color and pattern, color reflections within cylinders, transformations, camouflage, and other color ambiguities. Contrary to the generally held psychological opponent theory that presents red and green, blue and yellow, and white and black contrasts, Swinoff lists the psychological primaries as red, yellow, and blue. Enhanced by many splendid colored plates of the work of Swinoff and her students, this reference will reward anyone who is interested in three-dimensional color. </p></div>
