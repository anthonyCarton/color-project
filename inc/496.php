ISBN 0-8352-1733-7. </p><p class="annot">The author of Graphic Designer's Production Handbook, Norman Sanders is thoroughly familiar with production of graphic design and with printing black~and-white and colored photographs in publications. Half of this informative book consists of three chapters on color separation and the printing process, standards for images in color, and meeting the highest standards of color art. The author systematically explains the limitations faced by lithographers as they make the critical step between the transparency material (which makes up more than 85 percent of the color art submitted for printing) and the printed sheet. He urges photographers and designers to consult with lithographers in advance and provides systematic guidelines on how to compensate for limitations early on when photographs are made, in order to enable photographs to stand up better to the effects of the printing process. Consideration is given to the influence of colored printing inks, the limited range of light reflectance of paper, and the viewing environment. To improve the quality of the photograph, he recommends the use of view cameras, tripods, and contrast control. While photography books usually address 'issues involved in making the photographic image, the special feature of this handsome book is its thorough coverage of steps necessary to improve the translation of color transparency to a printed page. </p></div>
