London: Angus and Robertson, 1987. 135 pp. Glossary, color illus. 1sBN -207-8185409-o. </p><p class="annot">By the author of Designer’s Guide to Color 3, this publication usesa similar format to present nearly 1,400 groupings of two or more colors. Each page presents 15 simple outline drawings of a woman wearing a two- or three-piece garment. One part of the garment remains constant in color throughout a two- to four-page spread while the other part(s) change. The many different combinations of small flat color areas present a total of 53 basic colors. The brief text comments only in generalities and colors are never considered in combinations of more than four colors or in relation to personal coloration. However, the colorful format and number of examples may inspire designers seeking ideas for color combinations. </p></div>
