Princeton, NJ: Van Nostrand, 1961. 214 pp. Bibl., endnotes/footnotes, B/W illus. </p><p class="annot">Color perception is the topic that unifies 17 selected readings. Thefirst section includes writings, sometimes excerpted, by Young, Helmholtz, Hering, Ladd-Franklin, and other color vision theorists. The second part is devoted to selected works by post- 1920 theorists. The primary value of this anthology is that it provides easy access to pre-1960s original sources in one convenient reference book. </p></div>
