Cambridge: Massachusetts Institute of Technology Press, 1982. 423 pp. Endnotes/footnotes. ISBN 262-5702l- 1. </p><p class="annot">Goethe’s Theory of Colours was first published in 1810. Althoughsome of his scientific writings have since been refuted by physicists, Goethe’s poetic insight and keen powers of observation continue to interest humanists and those who study responses to color. His descriptions of “demanded” or afterimage colors and writings on the meaning of color are particularly fascinating. The brief introduction by Deane Judd helps establish a context for Goethe’s writing. This book lacks the beautiful color illustrations and supplementary materials that can be found in Goethe’s Color Theory edited by Matthaei and translated by Aach. </p></div>
