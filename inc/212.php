Chicago: Favor, Ruhl,1942. 61 pp. bibl., B/W illus. </p><p class="annot">Hiller proposes a pigment-based color system based on perceptualthreshold theory, that is, the theory that the eye cannot distinguish slight differences in color beyond a certain point. The author contends that the 24- hue psychologist’s system is weak because the steps between hues are not equal and instead proposes a modification of the system that adds six more hues for a total of 30. Hiller’s ten principal hues are yellow, orange, orange-red, red, purple, blue, turquoise, sea green, green and leaf green. These hues are said to parallel the psychological primaries and the complements mix to gray in paint. The color solid advocate is a cylinder with a gray scale at the core and all hues carried out an equal number of steps from the core. This fine example of a color system will interest those who study personal color models. </p></div>
