Adapted from the Life Library of Photography. 426 pp., Index, bibl., glossary. B/W illus., color illus. ISBN 0673398420. </p><p class="annot">This edition adds sections to a well-received text that adapts material from several earlier Time-Life photography publications. Its 16 chapters cover an encyclopedic range of topics. Two chapters -- one on basic design and another on color -- provide an excellent design foundation for photographers. The abundant photographs and instructive diagrams support clear and concise explanations of additive and subtractive primaries colored filters, color film emulsion layers, color changes in nature throughout the day, and color balance. The content is broken down into small units for ease of understanding so that concepts, skills, and techniques are presented as single topics on two facing pages. </p></div>
