Vol. 2, ISBN 0-935603-29-8. </p><p class="annot">Each volume in this lavishly illustrated series offers 500 patterns in three distinct color “schemes.” Each section provides a concept photo collage that sets the mood, a short descriptive paragraph, a color plate with 15 color bands related to the color theme, and a table with small samples of 25 patterns. Each section also includes over 30 pages of color plates that show various color ways and give CMYK percentages for the different patterns. Volume one is organized into three sections on natural colors, oriental colors, and high-tech colors. Volume two presents more color combinations under the headings of pop colors, retro-modem colors, and post-modem colors. The preface states that color harmonies and discords are culturally related. The superb color printing is reminiscent of recent Japanese books of printed samples and color collections, although there is no such attribution. Although intended as visual guide intended to inspire designers by example, explanation of the colors or patterns would be helpful. </p></div>
