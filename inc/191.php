<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">191. Tritten, Gottfried. Teaching Color and Form. New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1971. 147 pp. B/W illus., color illus. </p><p class="annot">Originally published in Switzerland, Tritten describes how hedevelops graphic techniques and color sense in children ages 1 l to 16. Written for the instructor, fully a third of the book presents color studies for children. Twenty-five exercises for learning to use color range from preliminary experiences such as a visit to the zoo, to color topics and studies appropriate for children. The lessons consists of two-page units with instructions for combining crayon, colored pencils, or watercolor with drawing. The first page presents the lesson plan, then lists and discusses materials, process, and evaluation. The second facing page shows examples of the resulting work by children. While there is no general introduction to color, color principles are discussed within the context of their application in specific lessons. This comprehensive, well-written, and generously illustrated text documents the authorâ€™s contribution to art education in Switzerland during the 1960s. </p></div>
