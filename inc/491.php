ISBN 0-6716889-8. </p><p class="annot">Technical aspects of color photography are covered very well in this book, as one would expect from a world-famous photographer. What is unique is that a third of this comprehensive work explains what color is all about, including color vision, perception, color mixing, color psychology and the meaning of color. The discussion of color description features the Munsell color solid and a 20-hue color wheel. Although he does not use the accepted term “simultaneous contrast” in his color relationships section, Hedgecoe demonstrates this important phenomenon as “neighboring colors.” Nearly 600 superb color photographs and many colored diagrams dramatize the nature of color and light. Guidelines intended to encourage good design are also incorporated. For example, for effective color he advises photographers to concentrate on the light rather than the subject, since “everything in the world changes its hue according to the light.” This inspiring and practical work continues to have enduring value as a general introduction to color, whether for photographer, designer, or the general reader who wishes to understand and apply color and light principles in creative work. </p></div>
