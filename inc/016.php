<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">16. Birren, Faber. Color Perception in Art. New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1976. 88 pp. Index, bibl., B/W illus., color illus. ISBN 0-442-20784-0.</p><p class="annot">A brief discussion of color usage in painting is followed by a short and sometimes inaccurate review of color theory. Topics include perception, illumination, and color constancy. The illustrations are uninspired and only moderately effective. A 35-item annotated bibliography and a listing of Birrenâ€™s major publications may be useful to some readers. Birren provides a minimum of new information in this book; most is better said and more fully discussed in his earlier books Creative Color and Color: A Survey in Words and Pictures.</p></div>
