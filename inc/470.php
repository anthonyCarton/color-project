This highly readable account follows the color revolution in daily newspapers through the 1980s and explains the new technology, with particular reference to USA Today the St. Petersburg Times, and the Orange County Register. Mario Garcia and Robert Bohle summarize published studies of newspaper color and briefly describe the results of their own research, which tested readers at four test sites who scanned newspaper front page, life-style, and sports pages in black-and-white and in several color treatments. Their systematic eye-movement test and semantic differential test are prototypes for research on the role of color in graphic communication. A strong case is presented for functional rather than decorative use of color in newspapers. This informative text, supported by fine illustrations, sets a very high standard for the graphic design field. An unannotated bibliography of 180 books and articles on color in newspapers through 1986 rounds out the book. </p></div>
