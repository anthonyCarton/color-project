ISBN 0-345-29015-1. </p><p class="annot">In the 1970s prescriptive books on creating images throughwardrobe planning became popular. In his Dress for Success series John Molloy concentrates on how clothing can project an image of power in the business world, entirely overlooking the effect of color on personal appearance. In direct contrast, Jackson’s aim is to enhance personal appearance through analysis of personal coloration and color preferences. She explains that all individuals can use her method to analyze the color of their eyes, hair, and skin, including olive and black skin, as the basis for selecting one of four color groupings based on spring, summer, fall, and winter colors. She also discusses fashion types, wardrobe, and make-up. Jackson’s program, which is now promoted by a large network of image consultants, continues to be popular with American consumers. The book lacks general discussion of color and any explanation of the exact relationship between personal coloring and the 30 colors recommended for the four palettes. </p></div>
