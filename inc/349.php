The sequence of color design foundation topics include problems and exercises for students of interior and exterior architecture. The six chapters thoroughly cover light and lighting effects on colors; color keys and contrasts; texture and light; bodies of buildings, buildings and environment; room and interior spaces, and technique. Many illustrations show stages in the design process, from preliminary drawings, layout, to final presentation of buildings. The text is lavishly illustrated with excellent color or B/W photos and diagrams. Uwe Koos, color consultant and art director for StoDesign International, is responsible for 20 Colour and Architectural Design studios in six countries, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, USA, France, and China, and is credited with many projects in the United States. Konrad J. Richter is senior master at the Industrial Professional Schools of the Rhein-Sieg-Kreis in Hennef, Germany.
