Birren’s notes in each chapter of Rood’s work also make reference to 20-century knowledge of the subject and so facilitate comparison with Rood’s original writings on perceptual color, including visual mix, simultaneous and successive contrast, complementary afterimages, and other relevant topics. Penelope Hobhouse notes that Rood’s writings on garden color from the original edition do not appear in this edition. </p></div>
