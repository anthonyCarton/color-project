New York: Dodd Meade, 1918. 282 pp. Bibl.</p><p class="annot">Although Luckiesh, a physicist, contends that color science provides the foundation for color application in the arts, he advocates a future art form “purely or predominantly of color” that bridges science and art. Since color has the ability to elicit direct human response, he believes there is a “language of color.” In an effort to find that language, he reviews mythology, color associations, and color in nature, language, literature, painting, religion, and theater. Symbolic uses of various colors are cited as evidence of the historic impact of color on individuals. Considerable attention is also given to the development of color nomenclature, color preference, and response to color. Discussions of aesthetics, harmony, color usage, and color-music conclude the book. Although dated, this book and its brief bibliography offer an interesting historic perspective.</p></div>
