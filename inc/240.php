<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">240. Johnson, Mary Frisbee. Visual Workouts: A Collection of Art-Making Problems. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall, 1983. 145 pp. Bibl., glossary, B/W illus., color illus. ISBN 0-13-942664-7. </p><p class="annot">The collection of 77 two-dimensional, three-dimensional, and colordesign exercises from the author’s design foundation classes rely entirely on a problem-solving and hands-on approach. All of the exercises follow the same format in an easy-to-read style. The problem is stated briefly, suggestions are made on how to get started, and, references are made to artists who do related work. The color section includes 22 color problems that explore color through painting, photography, video, game-making, and pop-up books. This approach may suit readers and instructors who share the author’s practical orientation and good humor, but others may be frustrated by the deliberate omission of a general overview of design elements and principles. Readers with a basic design background or instructors looking for inspiration may find imaginative ideas here. </p></div>
