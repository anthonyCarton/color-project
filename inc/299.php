San Francisco, CA: Quilt Digest, 1989. 143 pp. bibl., glossary, B/W illus., color illus. ISBN: 0-913327-20-4. </p><p class="annot">This highly instructive book deals with cloth as the color medium.Alter introducing Itten’s color wheel, the author explains grouping colors by hue, value, color temperature, symbolism, and mood. Next, cloth is examined for visual texture, scale, and contrast, and design strategies are recommended. In the third part color and cloth are combined into specific fabric, natural, and standard art harmonies. Each topic is carefully discussed, well illustrated, and accompanied by exercises for the reader to fill in with pieces of cloth. The instructive text moves the reader through increasingly complex color concepts and also gives directions for building a cloth collection. The unusually fine quality of the many color illustrations of patterned fabrics and quilt blocks can be attributed to the superb color printing done in Kyoto, Japan. In addition to covering color theory and necessary technical information, the author approaches the much larger domain of using fabric as the color design medium with considerable knowledge, zest, and sensitivity. </p></div>
