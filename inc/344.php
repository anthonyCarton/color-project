The assumption is that the color of facades signals some kinds of information. The study examines banks and churches; restaurants and retail establishments; hotels, educational institutions, and hospitals; restaurants; religious denominations; men’s and women’s clothing stores; and hotels and motels. The price level of products related to several of these groups is also noted, from least expensive to most expensive. Building facades were photographed, their colors matched to Munsell, and the results charted. The resulting color usage patterns are related to ongoing processes of “human action, interaction and communication.” The impressive sweep of the author’s interdisciplinary scholarship, and his concern for context and meaning of color make this an exceptionally interesting work for the serious reader interested in the built environment. </p></div>
