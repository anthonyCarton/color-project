Winter Park, FL: Green Apple, 1985. 1 1 pp. Bibl., B/W illus. </p><p class="annot">In 1978, members of Reevesâ€™ firm, Architects Design Group ofFlorida, interviewed inmates and learned that they hated the lack of colors in their jail. Their discovery that there was little research on the subject inspired this little overview of color in the prison environment. Frequent reference is made to the work of Faber Birren, including summaries of the psychological effects of six colors. The most interesting feature is a one- page space/color utilization matrix that augments the very brief discussion of behavior modification through color in a correctional facility. The matrix features five columns that list: kinds of spaces, such as inmate housing; desired behavior; psychological perception of space and time; suggested colors in order of preference; and perception of temperature as cool or warm. The unannotated bibliography lists 24 books and articles on the subject. </p></div>
