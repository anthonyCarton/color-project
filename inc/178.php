<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">178. Jacobs, Michel. The Art of Colour. Rumson, NJ: Primatic Art, 1948. 91 pp. Color illus. </p><p class="annot">Designed as a system for teaching the art of color, this workincludes portions first published in 1913. Fascinated with the theories of Helmholtz, Jacobs devised a way to relate the new knowledge of additive color mixing to paint. His 24-hue color wheel finds a place for both the spectral and the pigment primaries. One interesting feature of the book is the series of color plates showing bridging of complements in nine-step scales, which are then tinted to create a total of four value steps. The broad scope of this book is evident in the separate chapters on painting, printing, interior design, costume design, landscape gardening, cut flowers, weaving and textiles, dyeing and batik, stage lighting, and house painting. A final dictionary chapter covers hues and their place in the spectrum, complementary color, history, chemical properties, and psychology or association. Most of the paintings are by Jacobs and are mediocre. Little gems of information and a quaint style make this book a historic curiosity. This volume is related to Jacobâ€™s color course text The Study of Colour with Lessons and Exercises (1948). </p></div>
