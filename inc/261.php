An encyclopedic archive of documents and pictorial material originally published in German in 1962, the book deals very little with color directly, although it contains some material from Kandinskyâ€™s color course. However, the inclusion of the early work of Itten and Albers is of special interest in light of the influence of their later writings on art and design education. </p></div>
