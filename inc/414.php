New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold. 186 pp. Index, bibl., B/W illus., color illus. ISBN 0-442- 23539-9. </p><p class="annot">This comprehensive work by a leading architectural educator paves the way for the electronic colorist who designs with color. Topics include the language of color, and color contrasts and color dynamics based on Itten’s seven contrasts and Albers’s color deceptions, including Albers’s connection of afterimage and simultaneous contrast. The handsome computer-generated illustrations prove the value of the computer for generating alternative color ways, or placing a particular group of colors in several environments. The informative discussions synthesize scattered information on color triangles by Goethe and Maxwell and on Munsell, CIE, and Gerritsen color models. Most important for electronic colorists to understand color order in additive light mixtures are comparisons of Tektronix RGB (red, green, blue light primaries), HLS (hue, lightness, saturation) and HVC (hue, value, chroma) color spaces, the latter based on the ideas of Gerald Murch. A discussion of color psychology and meaning of color includes Goethe’s color logic which inspired a color system devised for architectural use by Koos. Final chapters address color in the design process and representation of form. Exercises for students and references conclude each chapter. The graphic computing was done on a VAX cluster of Digital mainframe computers using Tektronix terminals. </p></div>
