<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">422. Cheskin, Louis. Color forProfit. New York: Liveright, 1951. 209 pp. Index, appendix, color illus. </p><p class="annot">In this work on color design as a marketing tool, the author recommends eliminating personal taste and subjective judgment when selecting colors. Rather, he advocates a scientific approach based on controlled testing that relies on optical and psychological effects of colors and images, examines rapid eye movement and free association, and measures attention, retention, and preference. Cheskin first describes procedures for testing color and design effectiveness in home furnishings, apparel, and store interiors, and applies test results to package design, window displays, posters, and advertising. The author concludes that color preference is most influenced by specific value levels of the colors, presence of other colors, and the objects with which a color is associated. He recommends attention to color symbolism, associations, and proportion and endorses use of complementary hues. Basic information on the physical, chemical, and psychological aspects of color can be found in the appendix. This thorough book has little but historical value because it has been superseded by new works. </p></div>
