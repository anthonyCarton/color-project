Vol. 1, 381 pp.; Vol. 2, 283 pp. Index, appendix, B/W illus., color illus. </p><p class="annot">After producing the Hesselgren Color Atlas in 1952, the authorwent on to expand his 1954 doctoral dissertation into this two-volume textbook on architectural theory. The first section on perception psychology encompasses color, light,and illumination, while the second chapter treats the formal aesthetics of color and light. Other chapters deal with architectural expression, emotion-based connections to color, and architectonic rooms and townscapes. Especially useful are the summaries and references for further study. Because all of the illustrations are located in the second volume, the reader must flip back and forth to find the illustrations related to the complex text. This unusually comprehensive work deserves a better book design that integrates illustrations into the text. </p></div>
