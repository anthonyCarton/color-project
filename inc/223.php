ISBN 0-8019-7306-6. </p><p class="annot">This volume documents contemporary studio ceramics through thework of 188 outstanding contemporary potters in Western Europe, the United States, Australia, and New Zealand. The potters contributed photographs of their work along with statements on their personal motivation and individual techniques. Sections in the clearly written text give equal emphasis to sources of inspiration, ceramic form, decoration, and color in studio ceramics. The discussion of color for the potter is an important and central chapter in this work. Here the author describes and explains the importance of color relativity, advancing and receding colors, and color and tonal relationships. His impressive knowledge of the field comes from his work as a ceramist and his experience as an educator in the the School of Education at the University of East Anglia. </p></div>
