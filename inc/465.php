ISBN 0-442-21806-0. </p><p class="annot">This extensive survey of international visual symbols consists primarily of black-and-white illustrations of symbols with labels identifying their meaning. The symbols are organized in three ways: by discipline or field, by form and shape, and by meaning. An often-cited 16-page section on color deals with the symbolism of the primary and secondary colors plus brown, silver, white, gray, and black. This undocumented tabulation of color associations includes more than 25 different categories ranging from alchemy and art to traffic and travel. Further discussion of how color can be used to intensify a symbolâ€™s meaning would have been useful. </p></div>
