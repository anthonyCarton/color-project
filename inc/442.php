ISBN O-935603-06-9. </p><p class="annot">This step-by-step guide for choosing colors is founded on 61 basic colors. The 1,662 different combinations shown are arranged according to hue, to commonly used color schemes, and to use and mood. The text frequently refers to popular usage of colors and color combinations. The book’s most useful features are: a multitude of color combinations; twelve guidelines for choosing and using color; swatches of the 61 colors; and a chart for converting the identification colors from the Dainippon Ink & Chemicals’s DAI Color Guide to CMYK percentages for four-color printing. The interesting ten hue color wheel, reminiscent but not attributed to Munsell, incorporates process colors and appears to replace purple blue with one additional purple. Though the brevity of the text, and absence of explanation for the system may limit the usefulness of this book for some raiders, Color Harmony the text is more valuable than many color guides. </p></div>
