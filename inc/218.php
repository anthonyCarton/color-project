Collins, 1989. 120 pp. ISBN 0-00-412-455-3. </p><p class="annot">Wilcox proposes color-mixing principles that will yield total controlover the pigment palette. His method replaces the traditional red/blue/yellow three-color wheel with six equal hues that are assessed for permanence, intensity, and “bias” (the direction the color moves toward). The text is divided into sections on the nature of color, color sensation, and comparisons of additive, subtractive, and psychological primaries. Color- mixing principles are demonstrated in pastels, colored pencils, silk-screen inks, watercolor, gouache, oils, and acrylics. Most pages contain several exercises, colored diagrams, or samples of actual paint mixtures that illustrate the author’s points systematically. This beautiful, innovative, and practical book will guide anyone ready to learn to control and predict color quality in pigment. </p></div>
