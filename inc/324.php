Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1974. 272 pp. Index, bibl., B/W illus., color illus. ISBN 0-385-05653-2. </p><p class="annot">This excellent book begins with a historic overview of dye plantsand their usage over time. Dye processes using plant materials and natural fibers, including the method of over-dyeing, are briefly but clearly explained. More than 200 pages of dye recipes are arranged according to hue. Line drawings and photographs round out the thorough coverage of natural dyes, but the book lacks a general discussion of color theory and use as it relates to fibers. </p></div>
