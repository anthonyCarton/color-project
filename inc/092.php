<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">92. Higgins Ink Co. Color Digest. Brooklyn: 1953. 39 pp. B/W illus., color illus. </p><p class="annot">This book contains easy-to-understand explanations of colorphysics, light reflectance, color psychology, and additive and subtractive color mixing, but its main feature is a concise yet detailed description of the Ostwald color system. It presents the color wheel in terms of the 24-color Ostwald circle, which can be matched by Higgins Ink Company inks that approximate Ostwald hue standards. The reader is instructed to use Higgins drawing inks to color in the diagrams on paper bound into the book, which can be assembled into a three-dimensional “Higgins Ostwald Solid.” The clear, concise presentation of the Ostwald color system makes this a good second-choice reference when Jacobson’s Basic Color (1948) is not available. </p></div>
