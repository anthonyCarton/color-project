<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">294. Klein, Bamat. Eye for Colour. London: Collins, 1965. 136 pp. Color illus. </p><p class="annot">Known for his work as a designer and manufacturer of unusualwoven fabrics, the author explains his approach to color design and his love of color. The discussions, based on his own experiences, are enriched by his familiarity with historic traditions. Several autobiographical chapters are followed by comments on historical influences from the Egyptians to abstract expressionism. While the personal viewpoint of this book may limit its appeal for some readers, others may enjoy seeing how historic and other sources inspire one designerâ€™s richly colored and textured fabrics. </p></div>
