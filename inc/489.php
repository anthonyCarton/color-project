ISBN 0-8174-5419-5. </p><p class="annot">This book begins with a “Graphic Controls” section that provides an excellent introduction to design elements and principles, and then discusses photographic composition, from physical aspects to implied psychological nuances. The systematic yet imaginative approach to photography contains a useful 20-page section on understanding, controlling, and applying color concepts. The color section starts with the meanings of color, including physical and emotional responses, and color as a subject. Many other interesting aspects of color in photography are covered. For example, three brief essays devoted to the colors yellow, purple, and green, discuss human responses associated with each color and offer technical suggestions for dealing with photographic problems presented by these colors. Many color and black-and-white photographs and diagrams illustrate the design concepts and related technical information. The emphasis on color and design is central to this book, which will appeal to the thoughtful student or photographer.</p></div>
