The many illustrations by Dorothy Beebee include a yarn color wheel showing over 164 mushroom-dyed skeins. Descriptions of 100 dye mushrooms are illustrated with drawings by the second author. The well-organized section on identifying and classifying mushrooms for color is credited to Susan D. Ligonati-Barns. The practical instructions for keeping dye records and organizing a color swatch book will be useful to hand dyers. </p></div>
