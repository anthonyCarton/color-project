ISBN 0-8230-0760-X. </p><p class="annot">Borgeson holds that color drawing “consists of two major technical tasks: the drawing and the simultaneous color application.” The theme of his third colored pencil book is creating a look of complexity with fewer layers of penciled-in color. Photographs of five of the author’s illustrations document his design method from preliminary stages to completed colored pencil drawing. This practical book also shows many useful technical shortcuts developed in the author’s studio. Twelve pages of charts for the reader to fill in and several pages of small color swatches that show available Prismacolor and Derwent colors add to the usefulness. The high- quality of the illustrations and the instructive text will easily hold the attention of the design student or professional illustrator. </p></div>
