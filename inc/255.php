Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall, 1984. 274 pp. Index, bibl., endnotes/footnotes, glossary, B/W illus., color illus. ISBN 0-13-060l86-l. </p><p class="annot">This design text builds on the past experience and wealth of ideascompiled and integrated by three authors. The first section touches on conceptual problems that face designers and traces the evolution of design education and applied art. Here they introduce their curious term Nordic Modern, which they apply to the German Bauhaus designers and Swiss typographers who emphasized the functional and systematic, and then compare with the “post-modernist” reaction. The authors claim to synthesize the advantages of both approaches. Next they examine traditional and contemporary approaches to composition in a “systems” section that looks at grids, modules, forms, and patterns. The third section relates design elements and application of design principles to various kinds of designs and media, including illustration. The last section surveys application in graphics, domestic architecture, and conceptual art. Eleven pages of excellent color plates present subtractive and additive color, Munsell and Ostwald, pigments and printing inks, process color separation, simultaneous contrast, and a 12-hue circle. Notes for each chapter provide useful documentation for this ambitious and comprehensive work. The text seems accessible to beginning as well as to advanced students. </p></div>
