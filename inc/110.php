ISBN 0-8036-5500-X. </p><p class="annot">Patricia Sloane’s writings on color include Colour: Basic Principles and New Directions (1967), a dissertation on color from New York University, and many journal articles. In this unflinching examination of the conflicting color theories based on physics, psychology, and color vision she debates often unexamined assumptions underlying dogmatic Western color theories. Under five major topics - -color and language, color and light, color and form, color and culture, and color theory -- she discusses 35 important aspects of color. The historical basis for color theories is documented and woven into her discussions. Sloane “argues for a balance between theories about the invisible causes of color and theories that deal more profoundly with color’s phenomenological nature, that are rooted in visual experience and in intelligent assessment of that experience.” This is a challenging work aimed at the serious reader intent on discovering what the visual nature of color is and is not. </p></div>
