<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">367. Birren, Faber. New Horizons in Color. New York: Reinhold, 1955. 200 pp. Index, bibl., B/W illus., color illus. </p><p class="annot">Birren discusses color with reference to vision, perception, lighting and paint, and briefly mentions color harmony conventions. His treatment of color psychology and color usage is undocumented. Recommendations for use of color for architectural exteriors and interiors range from industrial plants to homes and include two pages of samples of recommended functional and decorative colors. The book concludes with summary information on light, vision, and systems of color organization. The significance of this book is as a record of the author`s early attempts to apply color theory to architecture. The five-page appendix of color systems and samples and the bibliography may be useful for those doing historical research on the topic. However, the work is too dated for contemporary application. </p></div>
