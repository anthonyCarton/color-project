Some of the topics in this exhaustive reference include problem solving; visual elements; volume and structure; the visual and physical attributes of form; perceptual principles of organization; and symmetry. Other interesting topics include reviews of historical influences on visual education; Gibson’s innovative study of gradients in depth perception (1950); perception of figure and form related to Gestalt psychology; and Gerritsen’s color concepts (1975), among others. The excellent 64-page color chapter surveys 16 historic circles, provides color plates and explanations for Ostwald, Munsell, and Pantone; and covers subtractive, and optical color mixing; traditional color harmonies; and afterimage and successive contrast. The discussion of color proportion is credited to Itten. Three-dimensional color studies using dowels are reminiscent of student problems in Dimensional Color by Swinoff (1989), which is not cited. Much of the documentation consists of lists of references that conclude each chapter but are not included in the index. Interestingly, the illustrations include student work from many educational institutions surveyed by the authors, and many exercises for students emphasize three dimensional experiments. The information from many sources on the historical, theoretical, and perceptual basis of design, and special coverage of industrial design concerns make this a well balanced text that will challenge students. </p></div>
