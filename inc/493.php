<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">493. Isert, G. The Art of Color Photography .New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1971. 411 pp. Glossary, B/W illus., color illus. </p><p class="annot">The color printing of this English edition, adapted by Leonard Gaunt from the original German edition, gives the book a dated look. However, several features of this highly instructive book are of enduring value. The first half covers photographic technology, optics, color vision, and lighting, and includes an excellent glossary. This work uses pairs or groups of photographs to illustrate important color and design principles, supported by text and small hand-drawn diagrams that analyze the color structure of every photograph. General guidelines for color photography are shown in 15 simple color plates. Unfortunately, one caption states simultaneous contrast effects incorrectly. But in general, the reader who studies the color section should come away with a heightened awareness of color design principles for color photography. </p></div>
