<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">393. Lacey, Stephen. The Startling Jungle. Harmondsworth, Middlesex, England: Penguin, 1986. 254 pp. Index, color illus. ISBN 0-670-80614-5. </p><p class="annot">In an interesting discussion about whether form should dominatecolor, the author compares classical and romantic gardening styles. Because the classical gardener’s emphasis on shape may result in rigid and unexciting garden plans, and the romantic gardener’s use of color may result in a wild and shapeless mass of plantings, Lacey says the best gardens balance elements of both styles. The two chapters on color review color theory and describe unifying color design strategies, such as using colors related by similar color temperature, intensity, or tone. Since the book has only 16 pages of color illustrations that range from Jekyll borders to details of plant groupings, the serious reader will need an illustrated plant dictionary at hand while reading the imaginative and elegant text. </p></div>
