News York: Wiley- Interscience, 1974. 248 pp. Index, bibl, B/W illus. </p><p class="annot">Evan’s final book features most notably a new organization of themain perceptual variables, beyond hue, saturation, and brightness. The first major section on single stimuli encompasses physics and physiology, metamerism and psychophysical variables, colorimetry, and afterimages. A second section on related stimuli, includes chromatic stimuli with achromatic surrounds. He identifies six psychophysical variables: “dominant wavelength, the purity, and the luminance of the stimulus, and the relative luminances, dominant wavelengths, and purities with respect to the surround.” The final section treats the observer and general stimulus. Evans’s dissatisfaction with his earlier explanations (An Introduction to Color, 1948) prompted further studies of saturation and the discovery in 1958 of a new visual threshold by Evans, Burnham, and Newhall. Armed with the new facts, Evans refutes some “firmly held beliefs” and historic oversimplifications, maintaining that the “importance of' gray and grayness of colors . . .is shown for the first time to be the important separate variable that it has always appeared to artists.” Although considerable prior technical knowledge is required for a full understanding of this complex material, the author’s clear style makes certain relevant sections accessible to interested design readers. Worthy of special attention are the accounts of the connection between illumination, brilliance, and color relativity, which challenge the dominance of color as hue, value, and chroma in the art and design literature. Other discussions related to visual design contexts include an analysis of saturation, brilliance, and chroma in the Munsell system, the Ostwald system, and Arthur Pope’s The Language of Drawing and Painting, which anticipates Evans’s four variables of hue, saturation, brilliance, and lightness. </p></div>
