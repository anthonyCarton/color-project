The color chapter, titled “Color: How to Use It and How Readers Perceive It,” describes the landmark color research commissioned by the Poynter Institute for Media Studies. Newspaper readers at four test sites scanned a front page, life-style, and sports pages in black and white and in several color treatments. A systematic eye-movement test and a semantic differential test provided innovative research findings on color in graphic design. The tightly organized and highly readable text, the excellent graphic design of complex visual material, and the fine black-and-white and color printing will inform and inspire design-oriented readers as well as journalism students and professionals. The 249-item bibliography is another asset. </p></div>
