<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">481. Stem, Walter, ed. Handbook of Package Design Research. New York: Wiley, 1981. 576 pp. Index, endnotes/footnotes, B/W illus. ISBN 0-471-05901 -3. </p><p class="annot">This essentially unillustrated text brings together 50 essays by experts in the field of package design research. The essays fall into seven broad categories: planning, package design research tools, design assessment in product development, package design research in the corporate structure, special markets, international package design assessment, and advanced package evaluation techniques. A seven-page essay by Bonnie Lynn, the only chapter that specifically addresses color research in package design, skims over the importance of color visibility, color preference and symbolism but includes neither documentation nor suggestions for further reading. Given the widely acknowledged importance of color in packaging, the lack of color information in this compilation of design research is disappointing. </p></div>
