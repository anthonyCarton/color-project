<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">335. Storey, Joyce. The Thames and Hudson Manual of Dyes and Fabrics. London: Thames and Hudson, 1978. 192 pp. Index, bibl., glossary, B/W illus., color illus. </p><p class="annot">Written by a teacher at the Philadelphia College of Textiles andScience, this thorough technical book includes detailed descriptions of natural and man-made fibers, historical background, industrial dye processes, cloth preparation, solvents, fixatives and thickeners. Direct, resist, and discharge methods are covered with considerable emphasis on “printing” the dyes on to the fabric, along with final treatment. Very little attention is given to color and then only as it relates to testing color fastness. The information is too brief for the general reader (it is not a how-to book) although the home dyer may find the overview of fibers and dyes useful. Although first published in the United States, it retains the flavor of its original British publishing house. </p></div>
