<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib special">322. Knutson, Linda. Synthetic Dyes and Natural Fibers. Seattle: Madrona, 1982. Index, glossary, B/W illus., color illus. ISBN 0-914842- 65X. </p><p class="annot">This clearly written and well-illustrated resource presentsinformation on fiber and dye chemistry that applies equally well to yarn and yardage. The chapters on protein fiber dyes and cellulose fiber dyes contribute to the authority and usefulness of the book. The attention to detail will satisfy both textile specialists and the “at home”dyer. Though brief, the chapter on color theory is thorough with an especially valuable illustration of the hue-circle location of blacks, browns, and other “neutral”colors. This is an excellent, well-organized reference for quiltmakers who dye their own fabrics. </p></div>
