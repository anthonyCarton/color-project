Edited by a senior member of the Eastman Kodak Research Laboratories, this compendium gathers sources “that are not well known or readily accessible” into one handy and instructive volume. MacAdam’s drastic pruning and editing of the original works by such writers as Isaac Newton and Hermann von Helmholtz makes the material vastly more approachable and interesting to the contemporary reader. </p></div>
