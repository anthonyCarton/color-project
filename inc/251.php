The advantage, he says, is that students learn to organize patterns well, which leads to formulating successful compositions. A major section called “The Anatomy of Color” thoroughly covers light, vision, color mixing systems, an innovative pigment color palette, and color psychology. There is also an excellent section on light effects. Black-and- white illustrations and diagrams on nearly every page, 14 colored pages of mainly fine arts images, and useful summaries at the end of every chapter make this highly challenging and comprehensive text more accessible to students. Painting and photography are well represented, graphic design less so. The author’s occasional references to the scientific literature in the form of brief notes and the selected bibliography are helpful. This fine “instructor’s edition” and the separate instructor's manual would strongly support a one-year core foundations program. </p></div>
