<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">186. Sloane, Patricia. Colour: Basic Principles and New Directions. New York:Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1967. 96 pp. Bibl., B/W illus., color illus. </p><p class="annot">The special focus here is on color in fine arts, especially incontemporary painting of the 1960s. A concise overview of many color systems and an explanation of historic and ethnic color use and color symbolism are followed by a description of basic color principles. There are frequent comments on works by great painters and contemporary artists, but the illustrations do not always relate to or throw light on the authorâ€™s points, which seem more related to teaching art appreciation or art criticism than to studio production, although practice exercises for students are included. </p></div>
