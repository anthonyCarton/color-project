<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">439. Sipley, Louis Walton. A Half Century of Color. New York: Macmillan, 1951. 216 pp. B/W illus., color illus. </p><p class="annot">The author’s history of the development of color photography and full-color photolithography relies heavily on archival materials he had access to as director of the American Museum of Photography. This highly detailed history tells the story of discoveries on two continents by pioneering scientists, inventors, printers, photographers, and other color workers. Their contributions, machines, processes, and even their portraits are shown, along with many of their masterpieces, often printed from the original color separations on different papers. Comparisons of the Ostwald and Munsell systems, explanations of the then new methods of xerography and electronic color scanning, and a pictorial survey of an exhibition at his museum that also celebrates A Half Century of Color complete this book. While this fascinating and encyclopedic book offers an amazingly comprehensive account by a well informed specialist, the lack of an index and references may prove a barrier to some users.</p></div>
