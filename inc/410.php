Ontario: University of Waterloo, Computer Graphics Lab, 1984. 348 pp. Bibl., glossary, B/W illus. </p><p class="annot">This collection of papers prepared for a 1984 SIGGRAPH (Special Interest Group for Graphics) color workshop addresses a range of topics including color vision, the CIE system, elementary color coding, color circles, and problems of scene rendering in computer graphics. Perception of form, color, and shape, and a glossary comprise two more chapters. Other papers include “The Human Visual System” by Bernice Rogowitz of the IBM Watson Research Center and John McCann’s “Calculating Color Sensations.” Color in film issues are treated in “Introduction to TV, Film, and Printing” by Eastman Kodak, and “Fundamentals of Color Film Technology” by John Blunden. The printing section which describes various color printers, is rounded off by Robert Kuslnew’s “Ink and Paper and Their Relationships to Color Perception.” The importance of this work is that it gathers writings by leading researchers in the industry into a single reference for readers with some prior knowledge of computer science. </p></div>
