Government Printing Office. 35 pp., B.W illus. </p><p class="annot">This collaboration by a textile chemist and a textile and clothingspecialist was published during the height of the Great Depression, in response to the “present wide-spread interest in handicraft work,” and in support of various governmental relief activities. The publication reports the results of systematic tests on 65 natural dye materials for dyeing cotton and wool. Information is organized for six hue families, as well as brown, gray, and black, all tested for fastness to light and washing. A brief but adequate discussion of color combinations is based on a traditional six-hue color wheel. Recommendations are given for using similar hues, unlike colors including complements, and color proportion with neutralized colors used for the largest areas. A key to colors and dye materials lists and cross lists 92 entries. Brief histories of some of the dye stuffs, interesting color lore, and practical information enliven this brief but practical resource. </p></div>
