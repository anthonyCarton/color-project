Livonia, NY: Graphic Arts Publishing, 1979. 109 pp. Index, glossary, B/W illus., color illus. ISBN 0-933600-01-1. </p><p class="annot">Southworth, who teaches color printing technology at the Rochester Institute of Technology, has created a concise color reproduction guide that literally fits into a shirt pocket. His book covers many aspects of color reproduction: basic additive and subtractive color theory, color reproduction, standard viewing conditions, choosing and evaluating transparencies for reproduction, color separation processes, color proofing, limitations of the printing process, and correcting printing problems. The color plates show details not always found in much longer guides to color printing. This definitive and concise reference book is highly recommended to graphic artists. The bookâ€™s systematic introduction of the color printing vocabulary in a 29-page glossary makes it especially useful for students or other novices.</p></div>
