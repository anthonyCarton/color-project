Baltimore: Munsell Color, 1981. 67 pp. Index, glossary, B/W illus. </p><p class="annot">Munsell explains the conceptual basis for his influential colorsystem, which uses measured scales of hue, value, and chroma to create and define colors. This is a primary resource that comes with two charts and color chips for the reader to paste in. Information for matching the colors in paint or ink is not provided. The complete Munsell color notation system, available from the Munsell Company as The Book of Color, comprises an international standard frequently used by color researchers.
