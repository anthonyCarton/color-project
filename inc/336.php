ISBN 0-89145-949-9. </p><p class="annot">Methods for changing already colored fabrics by dyeing them with asecond color are carefully explained and shown. Reasons for overdyeing, basic recipes, and guidelines for color mixing are given along with a chart that summarizes mixing principles. The excellent illustrations throughout include well-designed black-and-white drawings that appear in the technical section. Color photographs showing details of many fabrics before and after overdyeing are integrated into the lucid text. Six handsome quilts by the author incorporating overdyed fabrics are also shown. The author`s enthusiasm for changing the color appearance of fabric is conveyed as a liberating option for quilters who choose to work with printed fabrics. Although there is no broad discussion of color, a brief history of how dyes have developed is included in this handsomely designed and informative book. </p></div>
