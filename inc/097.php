<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">97. Maerz, A., and Paul M . Rea. A Dictionary of Color 2nd ed. New York:McGraw-Hill, 1950. 208 pp. Color illus. </p><p class="annot">The stated goal of this dictionary is to standardize color names, togive sources for color names, and to index all color names in English; thus it differs from systems that refer to colors by numbers. While they credit the 1929 edition of The Munsell Book of Color for its correctness of principle and completeness, Maerz and Rea present an alternative method that organizes color samples on a grid. Each of the 56 plates features printed color swatches arranged in 12 rows and 12 columns. Some plates show gradations between two colors. Curiously, some colors -- but not all -- are identified by a color name printed on the plate. The short explanatory text includes a brief history of color standardization and provides an interesting view into color naming methods of the time. </p></div>
