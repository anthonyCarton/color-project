New York: Odyssey, 1964. 47 pp. index, color illus. </p><p class="annot">This little book provides a thorough but extremely brief overview ofcolor from source, theory, effects, and use to symbolism and color in animals. While the scope of this book is amazingly broad, information on a particular topic is often limited to one or two sentences. This book is best suited as a pleasant little introduction to color probably intended for children in third grade and up or as entertainment for the casual adult reader. </p></div>
