<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">10. Kingston Polytechnic. <em>The Color Tree.</em> Kingston Upon Thames, Surrey: Kingston Polytechnic, 1981. 18 pp.</p><p class="annot">This is an unannotated bibliography of 120 publications found in the Knight’s Park Library of the Kingston Polytechnic. Prepared by the library’s Learning Resources Publication and Publicity Committee, it gives Dewey decimal categories and call numbers for the convenience of readers. The included categories are: architectural psychology, art, art theory, cosmetics, interior design, optics and physics, ornament, painting, pigments/painting materials, textile design-handicrafts, blindness, mixing/painting techniques, perception/psychology, systems/painting, technology, terms, theories/painting, and theories/physics. There are few titles on textile design or graphic design. The curious title derives from the cover, which appears to be a photocopy of an early drawing of Munsell’s color tree.</p></div>
