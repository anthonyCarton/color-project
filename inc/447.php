ISBN 0-8771-690-9. </p><p class="annot">This fourth title in the Designers Guide series consists mainly of small color samples printed in over 1,000 color combinations organized into four color “tone” groups that move from bright to clear and from deep to subdued. A section with three color combinations shows three variants, each with different proportions of the same three colors. Color categories shown include: light pale, bright dull, neutral and dull, vivid, vivid and dark, deep, deep and grayish, grayish. This guide is for those who find inspiration from leafing through different color combinations and proportions prior to making color decisions. Although CMYK percentages are given for matching, there is no explanation or critique of the colors. </p></div>
