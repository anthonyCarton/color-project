ISBN 0-89134-376-8. </p><p class="annot">The scope of this book is broader than the title indicates since itpresents methods and techniques that will work with any opaque medium, including paint and pastel. The text alternates between a highly personal account of the author’s methods, discoveries, and experiences, and a dialogue with an imagined student that offers sensible guidelines and strategies. Three central chapters focus on interpreting value, solutions to color problems, and capturing light, the latter accompanied by diagrams of related sections of the color wheel. Color harmonies are explained on the basis of a conventional six-hue color circle, with the recommendation to beginners that the palette be kept simple. The methods and photographs of work in process will be especially helpful to the beginner. For example, a demonstration of simultaneously solving composition and color problems offers 10 compositional models such as silhouette, diagonal line, and “three spot.” The range of illustrations and color possibilities is necessarily limited because only the author’s work, which seems to rely on middle and dark hues, is shown. Although some landscape subjects are included, paintings of figures dominate. This volume is most valuable for the many thoughtful and practical strategies it provides for the interested reader. </p></div>
