<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib special">484. Current, Ira. Photographic Color Printing: Theory and Techniques. Boston: Focal Press, 1987. 282 pp. Index, bibl., B/W illus., color illus. ISBN 0-240-51787-3. </p><p class="annot">The author states that his textbook is designed to guide the reader through the fundamentals of current tri-color theory as it applies to color photography. The book is organized into five chapters of general interest followed by eight highly technical chapters. Concise and clear explanations of aspects of human vision and the role of light sources and modifiers are helpful and relevant to other situations and contexts that involve color and light. The chapter on visual effects discusses simultaneous contrast and outlines other information that is foundational to color application in various media. The book design is uninspired, and it is disappointing that although there are numerous black-and-white figures, only 17 color photographs appear. However, the five introductory chapters have much to offer the serious general reader as well as the intended audience of photography students. </p></div>
