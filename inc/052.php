Tolworth, England: Fountain, 1987. 640 pp. Index, bibl., B/W illus., color illus. ISBN 0- 86343-088-0. </p><p class="annot">This encyclopedic work provides basic principles for creating,transmitting, and reproducing color “in the hopes that all those engaged in producing, selling, buying, or using colour pictures will be able to see the nature of the problems they encounter.” Four major parts focus on color fundamentals, color photography, color television, and color printing. Information on practical application of color principles in color reproduction is combined with discussions of relevant physical, physiological, psychological, or subjective dimensions of color. The 29 chapters address 350 varied topics such as the colorimetry of subtractive systems, printing color negatives, color scanners, color separations, video, and television display. Computer-generated pictures and electronic retouching are additions to this updated 4th edition. The general and thus more accessible introductory sections cover such topics as light sources and visual appreciation. Detailed explanations of the principles, processes, and calculations involved in specific applications, such as electronic cameras and image structure in color photography, await the advanced reader in the later sections. </p></div>
