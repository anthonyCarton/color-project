The Rays Are Not Coloured: Essays on the Science of Vision and Colour. London: Adam Hilger, 1967. 154 pp. Bibl., color llus. </p><p class="annot">This intriguing collection of essays gathers nine lectures into oneconvenient source for a wider audience, including those who make no claim to being scientists. The first essay describes how the “light which enters our eyes contains the characteristic imprints of both the illuminant and the surface. This is the heart of the colour-rendering problem.” Then he considers how tungsten and fluorescent lighting distort color rendering, discusses the merits of each light for a particular function, and moves on to iridescence in beetles and birds. In “Towards a Philosophy of Colour” he asks what is color and what is color for, and searches for a “harmony of conception about colour that is universally acceptable--not just to the colorimetrists or the psychologists or the dyers--but to everyone.” He shows us that “color is subjective since it is generated within us in the visual cortex but is transformed through the combined operation of our space and colour perceiving process into something objective and material.” The chapter “A Course on Colour For Schools” is reprinted in full as the introductory chapter in Introducing Colour By the Society of Dyers and Colourists (1975). These imaginative essays offer fascinating connections between daily experiences and aspects of vision -- that range from the visual task in night driving, television and the visual process, to diagnostic tests for color vision. When he ponders the beauty of a rose petal he helps us understand translucence and other wonders. </p></div>
