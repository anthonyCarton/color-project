B/W illus., color illus. </p><p class="annot">This manual presents the Ostwald system and contains 949 colorchips in 30 hue triangle charts, two near gray charts, a pastel chart, a gray scale, and the Ostwald hue circle. A 49-page text explains the system, the gray scale, hue circle, and the notation triangles. The text also outlines how to use the manual to achieve color harmonies and addresses technical issues such as materials and light reflectance (a table lists reflection factors). A “Descriptive Color Names Dictionary” lists color names and specifies the appropriate color from the 1948 edition of the manual. The 1958 system is out of print. </p></div>
