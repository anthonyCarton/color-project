ISBN 0-932946-16-X. </p><p class="annot">This thorough and well-organized book is a beautifully illustratedguide to color theory and practice for quilters. Beginning with a conventional 12-hue color wheel and definitions of basic color terms, McKelvey explains and illustrates color theories as they apply to quilts. Other discussions cover harmony, Ittenâ€™s seven contrasts, transparency illusion, and color symbolism. Each section is illustrated with color photographs of actual quilts or quilt blocks and includes exercises to help the reader gain hands-on experience with the concepts presented. Practical advice on choosing colors and fabrics for quilts is given. Very clearly written and visually interesting, this is the only book devoted entirely to color for quilting. </p></div>
