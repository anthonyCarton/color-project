ISBN 0-8050-3178-2. </p><p class="annot">After a 12 page introduction on the nature of color the writer launches aninteresting dictionary of names for color, some with a brief entry, others with longer essays for 353 colors names. She explains that some names are borrowed from 40 Indo-European languages. The single color plate that concludes the text shows 191 very small color chips that approximate some of the colors she has discussed. Each of the 26 chapters begins with a longer essay about one of the colors in that chapter, thus highlighting 26 colors in all. Each chapter begins with a small black and white drawing of an object that has inspired a color name. The “acknowledgement” section lists her sources. The many color stories offer delightful and easy reading for interested adults as well as juveniles. This modest book deserves more color plates.</p></div>
