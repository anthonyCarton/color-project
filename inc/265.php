New York: Macmillan, 1982. 358 pp. Index, bibl., endnotes/footnotes, glossary, B/W illus., color illus. ISBN 0-02-334540-3. </p><p class="annot">This introductory text is often used for design appreciation coursesbecause it surveys a broad range of design topics. The first section considers the plastic design elements individually as line, form, space, time, movement, light, color, and texture. Following a discussion of art principles, important cultural and historical contributions to design and the organic and inorganic materials of design are described. The relationship between design and the consumer is addressed in the areas of food, clothing, shelter, and art. Fewer than a dozen pages are devoted to light and color, yet in that short space the authors explain both the Prang and Munsell color systems, define conventional color harmonies, outline suggestions for color design, and review the subjective and symbolic qualities of color.</p></div>
