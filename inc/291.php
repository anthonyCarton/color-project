Englewood Cliffs, NJ : Prentice Hall, 1981.184 pp. Index, bibl., B/W illus., color illus. ISBN 0-13-797795-6. </p><p class="annot">While maintaining the importance of intuition and spontaneity in theuse of color, James also stresses that an understanding of the formal principles of color theory can be invaluable to the quilt designer. In a chapter on color design for the pieced quilt, he presents information on color theory, and application exercises that acquaints the quilter with concepts such as color temperature, value, gradation, transparency illusion, and simultaneous contrast. In addition to providing a discussion of quilting technique, this book addresses color from the perspective of good design. </p></div>
