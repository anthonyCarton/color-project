<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib special">292. Jestorp, Karen and Eva Kohlmark. The Textile Design Book. Translated by Inger Harrison. Ashville: NC: Lark, 1986. 160 pp. Index, color illus. ISBN 0-937-274-44-5. </p><p class="annot">The authors share their experience and enthusiasm for teaching color and textile design in Sweden in this charming book. In the introductory chapter on sketching objects from nature, the reader is led to discover color inspiration in the smallest fragments of nature, even from the colorful morsels in open-face luncheon sandwiches. The authors’ general instructions for creating patterns, borders, textures, stylized decorations, and pattern variants for textiles encourage invention and experimentation. Two color chapters cover achromatic fabric collages, gray scales, the character of colors, color associations and fantasy names, use of the color spectrum for color order, warm and cool, active and passive, and simultaneous contrast and more. A special feature of this book is its excellent explanation of the Swedish “Natural Color System” which is based on six perceived color sensations of yellow, red, blue, green, white and black. The folk art flavor and the many refreshing photographs of nature, architecture, historic and ethnic objects will inspire the reader to try the exercises that apply the color concepts. </p></div>
