New York: Watson-Guptill, 1991. 223 pp. Index, b/w illus., color illus. ISBN 0-8230-1384-7 </p><p class="annot">The color harmony section covers hue, value and intensity, monochromatic, analogous, complementary, split-complementary, and triadic relationships. Other topics includes historic hue circles by Newton, Goethe, Munsell, HÃ¶lzel, Itten, the 12 hue circle, color as light and as pigment, and color as sight and symbol. A media and technique section provides many examples with brief captions on the technique and the color scheme. The media surveyed include gouache, colored pencils, crayon, natural pigment watercolors and analine dyes. Figure, interiors, exteriors, and surroundings are among the subjects treated. The many handsome illustrations are by the authors or by their students at Pratt Institute of Architecture. Although the focus is on architectural illustration, the information on color in printing, and the concluding section on creating fantasy drawings for books, magazines, posters and cards will inspire graphic designers as well. </p></div>
