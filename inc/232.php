<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">232. Dondis, Donis A. A Primer of Visual Literacy. Cambridge: MassachusettsInstitute of Technology Press, 1973. 194 pp. Index, bibl. B/W illus., </p><p class="annot">Written from a visual communication perspective, this “primer”recommends design guidelines based on Gestalt perception theories. The author lists dot, line, direction, tone, color, texture, scale, dimension, and movement as basic visual elements. A list of “communication strategies” presents 18 pairs of contrasting terms, such as unity and fragmentation, that are well illustrated by a simple diagram and five graphic images such as posters or photographs, and accompanied by a brief explanation. However, in the rest of the book verbal explanations dominate. Black-and-white illustrations are the rule, except for two color plates that show a conventional 12-hue color wheel and simultaneous contrast, the latter accompanied by a discussion of afterimage. Further examinations of style, function, and message are related to photography, film, and television as well as to graphic design, painting, sculpture, and architecture. While the limited visual material makes the book seem dated, the explanation of the perceptual basis of design is of enduring value. </p></div>
