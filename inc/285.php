New York: MacMillan, 1972. 158. pp. B/W illus. color illus. </p><p class="annot">This easy to follow programmed manual for individualizedinstruction consists of units on the conventional art elements of line, form, color, texture, balance, proportion, emphasis, and rhythm. Each unit provides information in the form of frames with questions followed by answers for immediate response and reinforcement. Thirty pages are devoted to units on color theory and color in costume. Besides the many B/W diagrams are four pages of color plates that include the traditional 12- hue circle which the author attributes to Brewster. This book may be valued as an example of programmed instruction in apparel, and can be compared with other learning programs developed in the 1970s such as Color Primer I and Color Primer II for photographers and designers by Richard Zakia and Hollis Todd (1974). </p></div>
