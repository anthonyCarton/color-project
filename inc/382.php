Chicago, IL: Physicians’ Record Co., 1944. 253 pp. Index, bibl., B/W illus. color illus. </p><p class="annot">In his introduction Faber Birren commends Raymond Sloan’s innovative interior designs for hospitals. The author deals with responses to color and color preferences, presumably based on Birren’s work. Sloan declares that hospitals have finally ceased to be interpreted in terms of white. Subsequent discussions of appropriate interior design and color selection begin with the exterior of the building and surrounding grounds, move on to the entry, through spaces for visitors, patients, doctors, and nurses, and then finish with board rooms and sun rooms. The discussion of palettes reveals the gender stereotypes of the time when the author states that rest areas for doctors should reflect masculine color preferences, while colors for dormitories for nurses should reflect a ‘woman’s world.” While dated, this work provides a fascinating record of historic color usage in the health environment. It includes tipped-in color chips of 60 recommended colors and a comprehensive bibliography of 76 books and articles on the subject. </p></div>
