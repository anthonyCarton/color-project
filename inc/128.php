Boston: Fogg Art Museum, Harvard University, 1974.134 pp. Index, bibl., endnotes/footnotes, B/W illus., Color illus. </p><p class="annot">This catalog for a 1972 exhibition at the Fogg Museum begins with Howard T. Fisher’s excellent overview of color, which pays special attention to a color solid by Arthur Pope, a teacher in Harvard’s Fine Arts Department from 1906 to1949. James M. Carpenter discusses the exhibition premise that art can be better understood when color relationships are understood. Pope’s approach to color analysis, which emphasized the variability of color perception, is discussed and illustrated in diagrams of paintings selected from the exhibition. Supplemental material includes Pope’s own description of his color solid and Fisher’s geometric transformation of the solid, which allows simultaneous display of hue, value, and intensity. The reader interested in Pope’s color solid will find this to be an excellent resource. </p></div>
