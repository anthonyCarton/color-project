ISBN 0-442- 30432-3. </p><p class="annot">This clever guide to process colors by a design team at Quarto Publishing in London, consists of a spiral-bound manual with an eight- page introduction that explains how to use the manual and how the four- color process works. Two methods of choosing and specifying color are described: first is a proprietary color swatch book, such as Pantone®’s, which presents solid areas of color printed using premixed inks; the second is based on a process-color tint chart that shows optical mixtures of the four process colors in a conventional grid format, along with percentages for matching. The colors in this manual are made with process colors. As opposed to the inflexible grid format, in order to permit the designer to see color combinations the manual is composed of sets of 2-3/4” by 6- l/4” color swatches, bound into four adjacent groups, that can be flipped freely. The claim is made that the 600 individual colors can be flipped into 30,000,000 different combinations. The introduction warns that process- color inks can vary slightly because different standards are used in the United States, Britain, Europe, and Japan. The guide was printed in Hong Kong using a black, cyan,magenta, and yellow printing sequence. </p></div>
