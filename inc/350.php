ISBN 0-907621-29-5. </p><p class="annot">The broad scope of the book and the author’s sensitivity to color inboth the natural and built environment comes out of his background as both architect and landscape architect, as Richard Gloucester tells us in the foreword. Aspects of environmental color in Europe as well as in Britain are featured in this compact yet comprehensive book. Neatly organized major sections cover the nature of color, the geography of color, color and new structures, and color guidelines. A special section on regional color follows Lenclos’ method of documenting the soil, rocks, paving, plants, traditional buildings, and townscapes. The concise “Colour Effects” chapter deftly summarizes color and light theory, principles of paint mixing, additive and subtractive color primaries, color meaning, presence of color in nature, color “attachment” or relationship of color to its background color, Itten’s seven color contrasts, color balance and assimilation, and more. With this beautiful book Lancaster joins the company of inspired English architects Alexander Hardy and Tom Porter, who write so eloquently about color in the designed environment. </p></div>
