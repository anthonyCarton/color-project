ISBN O-89009- 55 1-5. </p><p class="annot">This Quarto production combines an excellent and wonderfullyconcise text with splendid illustrations. An introduction to the history of watercolor is followed by an orientation to materials and equipment. However, the heart of this approach is revealed in the central chapter, where principles of composition, perspective, color theory, and watercolor theory are explained. Final chapters cover landscape and seascape, the figure, portraits, still life and natural history. The color section emphasizes color as reflected light,and thus presents both pigment and light primaries and complements. The color innovations of Chevreul and Seurat are outlined and related to printing and painting. Reminiscent of Robert F. Wilson’s terminology, “juxtaposition of color” is used rather than “simultaneous contrast.” Images and diagrams show how adjacent colors influence each other. Watercolors from museum collections as well as step-by-step photographs of work by contemporary artists or the author provide visual documentation on every page. This excellent group of watercolors inspires and teaches by example. </p></div>
