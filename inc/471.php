<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib special">471. Garcia, Mario R. , and Pegie Stark. Eyes on the News. Edited by Ed Miller. St. Petersburg, Florida: The Poynter Institute, 1991. 96 pp. Bibl., B/W illus., color illus. </p><p class="annot">This is a highly readable and beautifully designed presentation of the Poynter Institute 1985 research project that used EYE-TRAC® equipment to record how participants in three American cities followed color and process images and print in newspapers. Many of the findings challenge previously held myths and design formulas. The authors recommend hierarchy, sequence, and points of entry as principles for effectively designing with color. The authors’ guidelines for improving color design in newspapers start with understanding readers’ eye patterns, designing for electronic scanning technology, reviewing the Poynter color research, and learning to experiment. Other sections focus on photographs, art, and colors in the 1990’s. Throughout the book -- and especially in the color primer section and the tine information design section that presents their research statistics -- the color design is both functional and glorious. This visually exciting and superbly printed book will inform and inspire by example. </p></div>
