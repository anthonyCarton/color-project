ISBN 0-442-22645-4. </p><p class="annot">This clear presentation of Gerritsen’s color theories emphasizeshuman perception and the physics of light rather than pigments or inks. A comprehensive work, it includes thorough explanations of subtractive, additive, and partitive color; how the eye senses and perceives color; and simultaneous contrast. A three-page transparent overlay of Gerritsen’s color circle illustrates both additive and subtractive color mixing. Excellent illustrations combine with practical application of the ideas to make this a valuable resource. </p></div>
