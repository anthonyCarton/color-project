Tokyo: A + U, 1987. 196 pp.Color illus. </p><p class="annot">Although the author’s intent was to focus his camera on images oflight, his remarkable photographs also reveal the powerful interrelationship of light and color. Early on, the author states that “light ‘colours’ things and ‘tunes’ men, and determine [s] the atmosphere or mood of the place.” This view inspires the author’s text and his unusual photographs of the inner and outer faces of architecture around the globe. The book is organized into three chapters on light and matter, light and space, and light and time. Each chapter includes essays on a dozen imaginative subtopics, followed by nearly 40 pages of magnificent color photographs. A special feature is the use of choice quotations that appear in the margins to supplement or document the discussions of light and color concepts and related ideas. The text of this lavishly illustrated special edition of the December 1987 issue of Architecture and Urbanism is in both English and Japanese. The introduction is by Christian Norbert-Schulz. </p></div>
