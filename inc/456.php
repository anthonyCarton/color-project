ISBN 0- 289-8000-5. </p><p class="annot">The author shows and explains many colored pencil techniques in drawings that vary from tightly controlled illustrations to loose sketches. For some examples he documents the design process in photographs that show the beginning point, which may be a photograph or sketch, and follow through to completion. A chapter on color composition covers basic color theory which includes advancing and receding color relativity. Another chapter on creating color provides an analysis of how to build pigment color in layers. Several colored illustrations and many eclectic examples provide a broad survey that should satisfy readers seeking inspiration as well as instruction on technique. </p></div>
