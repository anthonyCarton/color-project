New York: Van Nostrand, 1969. 340 pp. Index, B/W illus., color illus. </p><p class="annot">Trichromatic color measurement principles, methods, andapplications are discussed in 10 chapters that focus on the visible spectrum, perception of color and light, photometry and colorimetry, the CIE system, metamerism, metrology, and color solids. Applications are discussed with reference to spectrophotometers, colorimetry, industry, dyeing, lighting, food, chemical tests, paint, signs and signals, and three-color reproduction in photography, printing, and television. While nonspecialist readers may find information on topics of personal interest, they may be stymied by the many formulas and charts which require considerable prior knowledge. </p></div>
