ISBN 0-87491-748-4. </p><p class="annot">Written for the general public, this book will appeal to those who follow the popular “seasonal color” palette suggested for wardrobes by Carol Jackson and other writers. The authors work on the assumption that the best colors for one’s wardrobe are also the best colors for selecting home furnishings. They tell how to determine an individual’s seasonal color palette and then provide related decorating palettes that utilize one of the following plans: monochromatic; analogous; contrasting; neutral; and white plus a hue. They also suggest furniture styles appropriate to each season and give general information on room arrangements and furnishings. This book’s unique approach to interior design decisions is interesting, although the authors’ association of personality types, seasonal colors, and furniture styles is speculative and undocumented. </p></div>
