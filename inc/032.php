ISBN 0-442-20787-5.Â </p><p class="annot">Among the best of Birrenâ€™s many books on color, this volume includes a very general summary of relevant research and writing. The biological, visual, emotional, aesthetic, and psychic responses of human beings to color and light are presented. The strength of this book is Birrenâ€™s ability to synthesize varied information on color, including the meaning of colors to different cultures, historical meanings of color, the healing effects of colors, and the meanings of personal color preferences Unfortunately, the chapter on the meaning of personal color preference is undocumented, however the extensive bibliography identities some sources for further study.</p></div>
