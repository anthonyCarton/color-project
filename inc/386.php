New York: Walker, 1881. 192 pp. Index, B.W.illus., color illus. ISBN O-8027-0665-7. </p><p class="annot">Self-expression in the garden is the author’s organizing theme.While some discussion of color appears throughout the text, the “Joyous Color” chapter concentrates on doing or redoing a garden on the basis of color and encourages “garden-artists” to become aware of their own color preferences and enthusiasms. Suggestions for flamboyant flowering shrubs, trees and bulbs, dissonant colors, strong colors, and strong contrasts are balanced by more conservative options such as using a narrow spectrum and making one color dominate. The author also presents dramatic ideas for garden structures, embellishments, and innovative uses of plants. </p></div>
