By the author of <span class="style">Designer’s Guide to Color 3,</span> this publication uses a similar format to present nearly 1,400 groupings of two or more colors.</p><p>Each page presents 15 simple outline drawings of a woman wearing a two- or three-piece garment.</p><p>One part of the garment remains constant in color throughout a two- to four-page spread while the other part(s) change.</p><p>The many different combinations of small flat color areas present a total of 53 basic colors.</p><p>The brief text comments only in generalities and colors are never considered in combinations of more than four colors or in relation to personal coloration.</p><p>However, the colorful format and number of examples may inspire designers seeking ideas for color combinations.</p><h1>start</h1><p class="paragraph_style_2">269.</p><p>Anderson, Barbara, and Cletus Anderson.</p><p><span class="style">Costume Design.</span> New York: Holt, 1984.</p><p>401 pp.</p><p>Index, bibl., B/W illus., color illus.</p><p>ISBN 0-03-060383-8.</p><p>    This excellent text on designing costumes for the theater combines conceptual material on costume design history, psychology of clothing, and color on the stage, with practical information on techniques for developing, sketching, and making costumes.</p><p>Color is presented as a powerful design element that must be understood and carefully controlled because of its immediate impact on audiences.</p><p>The “Color theory and Effects” chapter covers color characteristics and discusses Itten’s seven color contrasts.</p><p>In reviewing color associations and symbolism, the authors note that audiences bring these associations with them to the theater and can be expected to react to colors in certain ways.</p><p>Strategies for applying theoretical color information to productions are given, and the effect of colored light on fabric is also considered.</p><p>The illustrations in the color chapter are taken from Itten’s <span class="style">Elements of Color</span>.</p><p>Excellent bibliographies on costume history and costume design add to the value of this book.</p><p>The clear explanations of the interaction of color and light will be especially useful to students and practitioners.</p><h1>start</h1><p class="paragraph_style_1"><span class="style_1">270</span>.</p><p><span

Caroline Baker created this lively spiral bound “file” of Benetton ideas on color and apparel.</p><p>In the introduction Luciano Benetton states that “colour was my first business idea: designing clothes purely by colour was a totally original concept.” His passion for color is at the heart of this exuberant statement on life-style and fashion.</p><p>Various sections present color theory and color preference; a self-test for four personality and mood types; and eleven different hues, values, or color groupings illustrated by Benetton garments.</p><p>Other garments demonstrate camouflage, playing with pattern, and themes related to occasion or function.</p><p>An afterimage exercise is suggested for the reader to follow.</p><p>While books on color and fashion usually only give general guidelines, this one provides an exciting approach to color that can be followed up in Benetton shops.</p><p>The unusual design of the file and vivid use of color will cheer anyone with an eye for color.</p><h1>start</h1><p class="paragraph_style_1">271.</p><p>Burris-Meyer, Elizabeth.</p><p><span class="style">Color and Design in the Decorative Arts.</span> New York: Prentice-Hall,

principles.</p><p>Much of the information is now dated, but this book is interesting for its historical perspective on the teaching of color in an applied design format.</p><p>A classic of its type, it is frequently cited in bibliographies for that reason.</p><h1>start</h1><p class="paragraph_style_1">272.</p><p>Chambers, Bernice G.</p><p><span class="style">Color and Design in Apparel.</span>

surveys all aspects of apparel -- design, design periods, fashion, selection of apparel, and grooming -- and contains 40 pages on men’s clothing.</p><p>The substantial color harmony and color selection chapters include a color plate with 21 paint chips based on colors selected by the Textile Color Card Association.</p><p>Although this informative work has a strong flavor of the 1930s, it may hold historic interest for some readers.</p><h1>start</h1><p class="paragraph_style_1"><span class="style_1">273.</p><p>Davis, Marion.</p><p></span><span class="style_2">Visual Design in

elements, especially as they relate to clothing design, are clearly and logically presented here in separate chapters on individual principles and elements.</p><p>Illustrations are abundant and up-to- date.</p><p>Two excellent chapters cover light and color more thoroughly than many basic design or clothing design texts.</p><p>While the focus is on clothing, the underlying information is so

principles.</p><p>Clear and concise explanations of her visual analysis process are well supported by numerous illustrations.</p><p>The brief discussion of color covers color characteristics, warm/cool contrast, simultaneous contrast, visual mix, spatial proportion, meaning, and priority.</p><p>Useful visual exercises for students are provided at the end of each chapter.</p><p>Those

together the exciting work of 22 leading illustrators from four great international fashion capitals: New York, Paris, Milan, and London.</p><p>Comments on color appear in the short introductory text and in the captions on the artist’s purpose that accompany each illustration.</p><p>The author’s main point is that expressive fashion illustration is triumphing again over photography and color is a vital component of fashion illustration.</p><h1>start</h1><p class="paragraph_style_1">276.</p><p>Franz, Carl.</p><p><span class="style">ColorMe Macho.</span> Santa Fe, NM: John Muir, 1985.</p><p>112

from “Machismo: The Myth and the Majesty” to “Your Closet: Heart Of Darkness.” The author claims that the task of producing the text and the contrived photographs occupied a team of eight consultants

cultural, psychological, physical, economic, and aesthetic contexts.</p><p>The author discusses color in dress in several chapters as an aspect of artistic perception and expression, as it relates to standards of beauty and taste, and as it influences appearance.</p><p>She covers the three dimensions of color in the Munsell color system, afterimages, simultaneous contrast, and the standard color harmonies.</p><p>Unlike many texts, this one provides the reader with footnotes and a short bibliography after each chapter.</p><h1>start</h1><p class="paragraph_style_1">278.</p><p>Jackson,

prescriptive books on creating images through wardrobe planning became popular.</p><p>In his <span class="style">Dress for Success </span>series John Molloy concentrates on how clothing can project an image of power in the business world, entirely overlooking the effect of color on personal appearance.</p><p>In direct contrast, Jackson’s aim is to enhance personal appearance through analysis of personal coloration and color preferences.</p><p>She explains that all individuals can use her method to analyze the color of their eyes, hair, and skin, including olive and black skin, as the basis for selecting one of four color groupings based on spring, summer, fall, and winter colors.</p><p>She also discusses fashion types, wardrobe, and make-up.</p><p>Jackson’s program, which is now promoted by a large network of image consultants, continues to be popular with American consumers.</p><p>The book lacks general discussion of color and any explanation of the exact relationship between personal coloring and the 30 colors recommended for the four palettes.</p><h1>start</h1><p class="paragraph_style_1">279.</p><p>Kentner, Bernice.</p><p><span class="style">Color Me a Season: A

fashion design guide by Allen (1987) that also features superb Japanese color printing.</p><p>The introduction features a 16-hue circle, a diagram of ten color families, and brief discussions of warm and cold, opposing, and juxtaposed colors.</p><p>Most of the pages of this 9” by 12” book feature spirited full-page fashion drawings of three figures in western dress that are labeled throughout as sexy-modem, sporty, or feminine.</p><p>Below each figure which is drawn in pencil and splashed with bold watercolor or pastel strokes, is a visual footnote in the form of small color proportion swatches with CMYK percentages needed to match the colors.</p><p>Interesting captions describe the impact of the colors or suggest cultural or other color associations.</p><p>The result is an exciting

public relations specialist.</p><p>The premise of their book is that color is “central to successful appearance.” The range of live color types presented, all based on hair and skin color, includes dark and black skin colors.</p><p>Core colors recommended for each type are organized into purse- sized color charts on the book jacket.</p><p>A lively “Changing Images” section suggests color and dress for six different roles that women play in the workplace and after five.</p><p>Lavish photographs enhance the brief and readable text.</p><h1>start</h1><p

gender, age, class, status, and opinions.</p><p>The 30-page chapter on color and pattern focuses on the impact of color and the associations attached to the primary colors, secondary colors, black, white, and brown.</p><p>Lurie also looks at the use of stripes, plaids, checks, dots, flowers, and words on clothing.</p><p>This is a delightfully entertaining explanation of fashion choices as a

calculated approach to clothing selection and purchase on the basis of the desired or appropriate image related to the business world.</p><p>He claims that his recommendations, which cover every aspect of a “gentleman’s” personal wardrobe from ties to socks, are based on his own extensive research.</p><p>He scatters brief generalizations on the negative or positive effect of clothing colors in the one- to two-page discussions of suitable color and color conventions that appear in most chapters, but he ignores the effect of color on personal appearance.</p><h1>start</h1><p

0-446-87672-0.</p><p>    This author of books on dressing for success for men states that most women dress for failure because they are unduly influenced by fashion, socioeconomic background, and perception of themselves as sexual objects.</p><p>He recommends “wardrobe engineering” to achieve a more satisfactory response from clients, coworkers, and supervisors.</p><p>This includes both style of clothing and accessories and optimum color choices for “power” clothing.</p><p>Molloy claims that his authoritative advice is based on scientific research but does not reveal his data or sources.</p><p>This book aims at the general rather than the academic/scholarly reader, which may explain but does not excuse the absence of documentation.</p><p>Carleton Wagner addresses the color aspect of the same issues in his books, but Molloy is more thorough and more convincing.</p><h1>start</h1><p class="paragraph_style_1">285.</p><p>Pankowski, Edith, and Dallas Pankowski.</p><p><span

This easy to follow programmed manual for individualized instruction consists of units on the conventional art elements of line, form, color, texture, balance, proportion, emphasis, and

and color in costume.</p><p>Besides the many B/W diagrams are four pages of color plates that include the traditional 12- hue circle which the author attributes to Brewster.</p><p>This book may be valued as an example of programmed instruction in apparel, and can be compared with other learning programs developed in the 1970s such as <span class="style">Color Primer I</span> and <span class="style">Color Primer II</span> for photographers and designers by Richard Zakia and Hollis Todd (1974).</p><h1>start</h1><p class="paragraph_style_1">286.</p><p>Ryan, Elaine, with Pam

designer, maintains that the reader’s confidence in their ability to deal with color will improve after completing the included exercises, which range from viewing fruits and vegetables in a supermarket test to identify color preferences, to a review of color taste related to childhood experiences.</p><p>This popular color psychology book is similar to the many titles for selecting color

preferences in clothing, declaring that the wearer’s personality, attitudes toward others, emotional contentment or discontent, and other aspects of the emotional and material sides of life can be discerned from clothing-color choices.</p><p>He differentiates between inner and outer clothing, whether worn on the upper or lower body, and gives associations for nine color families, warm and cool colors, and male and female colors.</p><p>This curious and undocumented book, with only one black-and-white illustration, may be of some interest to those seeking entertaining lore on “reading” character clues from clothing-color choices.</p><p>Readers may wish to compare Steven’s verbal color test with the Liischer or Friehling color tests, which provide color samples.</p><h1>start</h1><p
