Springer Series in Optical Science. 137 pp. Index, endnotes/footnotes, B/W illus., color illus. ISBN 3-540-09654-X. </p><p class="annot">Clear definitions of basic color vocabulary are followed by a scientifically grounded discussion of the physical properties of light waves and colorants. Perception, light, additive and subtractive color mixture, mixture by averaging, color measurement or colorimetry, and chromaticity using the CIE diagram are especially well covered. Of special interest are chapters on identifying colors, and a comparison of the Munsell, Ostwald, Natural Color System, and CIE color classification systems. This technically sound presentation is accessible to the dedicated reader, whether student or professional. The list of references in the endnotes and the rigorous documentation increases the bookâ€™s value. </p></div>
