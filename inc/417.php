<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib special">417. Thorell, Lisa G. and Wanda J. Smith. Using Computer Color Effectively: An Illustrated Reference. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall, 1990. 258 pp. Index, B/W illus., color illus. ISBN 0-13- 93 9878-3. </p><p class="annot">One might expect this to be another book on graphic computing technology, especially because the authors worked in close association with Hewlett-Packard which provided most of the color images. However this comprehensive work addresses issues that are foundational to understanding all computer color imaging - whether PC or Macintosh - such as color vision fundamentals, color visual comfort, and emotional responses to color. Systematic interpretation and application of research findings from diverse sources is the special theme. For example, in the first section the authors distill five main findings from 42 human factors engineering studies on color coding and search tasks. They also discuss the benefits of computer color, color physics, and factors that influence responses to color. The second part presents “Technical Aspects of Vision and Computer Color” while the last part concludes with a wonderfully concise “Color Application Guidelines” chapter. The complete list of references for each chapter provides an excellent bibliography, and a full glossary rounds out the book. The uneven quality of the color reproduction of the illustrations that appear on most pages is testimony to the problems of transferring computer color to hard copy. However, the clearly written text makes this an excellent reference for general readers as well as for the technically minded. Designers will find the “Color Image Quality” chapter on color contrasts, image quality, and legibility and the highly practical final chapter of special interest. </p></div>
