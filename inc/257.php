<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">257. Roukes, Nicholas. Design Synectics: Stimulating Creativity in Design. Worcester, MA: Davis, 1988. 224 pp. Index, bibl. B/W illus., color illus. ISBN 87192-198-7. </p><p class="annot">In the introduction the author describes synectics as a theory ofcreativity and discusses his collection of provocative design verbs. This is followed by five lively sections on substructure of design, design and synectics, design and signification, paradox and humor, and change. Each section concludes with several “studio action” ideas for students that are illustrated with examples by artists or students. In contrast to the innovative and energetic design ideas and discussions, the color section is derivative and minimal, limited to a replication of Itten’s 12-hue color wheel and seven color contrasts, and two paragraphs on color chording and discordant color. This is rounded out by a 14-page “color gallery” with color plates of paintings, light sculpture, mixed media, and computer-generated images, accompanied by very brief descriptive captions. Most of the many black- and-white illustrations reflect a fine arts perspective. The author deliberately warns off those seeking reason and order and encourages those who want to “mobilize fantasy and ‘off- the- wall’ thinking.” </p></div>
