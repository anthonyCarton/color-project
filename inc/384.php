ISBN 0-397-47315-X. </p><p class="annot">Originally published in 1937, the book was intended as a compendium of available information on the subject. The largely unchanged first half of the book provides a broad survey of period decoration and furniture organized under styles. A history of painting and graphics and discussions of contemporary furniture, architecture, and design complete the first part. The second part, which covers the basic interior, design materials and accessories, and interior planning, features new contributions by other writers, including Sheila Chapline and Olga San Giuliano Menaker, who briefly discuss many topics in their 16-page color chapter. These include additive and subtractive color, Ostwald and Munsell color systems, color mixing techniques, simultaneous contrast, value relations, the effect of natural and artificial light on color, color aesthetics, color plans, color psychology, and use of color in traditional and contemporary interiors. A black and white diagram presents a traditional hue circle with red, blue, and yellow primaries. The lack of color illustrations in this chapter is unfortunate, as is the seemingly arbitrary location of what color plates there are. Although this book is still useful as a general reference, particularly for the historic sections, more current publications are available. The bibliography for each chapter extends through the 1960â€™s. </p></div>
