New York: Reinhold, 1969. 96 pp. Bibl., B/W illus., color illus. </p><p class="annot">Birren attempts to present a simplified summary of the Munsell colorsystem and includes an edited version of the 1921 edition of Munsell’s A Grammar of Color, but his repetitious rendering lacks clarity and unnecessarily confuses the reader. A careful reading of the primary source, Munsell’s A Color Notation (12th ed., 1971), is preferable to Birren’s discussion of color harmony and color notation based on the Munsell system. </p></div>
