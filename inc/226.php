<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">226. Bates, Kenneth F. Basic Design: Principles and Practice. New York: Barnes and Noble, 1960. 175 pp. Index, bibl., B/W illus ISBN 0-69- 463497-3. </p><p class="annot">The author, who taught enameling and design at the ClevelandInstitute for Art for 40 years and is known for his work in enamels, presents an overview of basic design concepts. He describes a design process that leads to practical application in sketching, painting and sculpture as well as in the applied arts areas of ceramics, enamels, textiles, and weaving. A chapter on design in sketching and painting includes a brief color section that focuses on the Munsell system. The book is written in a conversational style, as if between instructor and student. The dated illustrations and the lack of color plates severely limit the appeal of this book, although it does offer a historic perspective on basic design in the 1950s. </p></div>
