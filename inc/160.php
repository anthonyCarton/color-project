The first volume looks at color in natural and synthetic materials. The second focuses on the spectrum, paints and inks, and color as sensation. The third volume, which concentrates on Munsell, color balance, simultaneous contrast, afterimages, and complementary colors, is especially interesting for its examples of color relationships, including some relatively complex color combinations. This series will be of interest primarily as a record of color resources from the thirties. </p></div>
