ISBN 0-87701-739-5. </p><p class="annot">Problems of color fidelity when reproducing the appearance of additive color on the computer screen as subtractive color output on paper continue to plague graphic designers. The authors claim that the computer- generated samples in their book will allow users of Aldus Freehand, Aldus Pagemaker, Quark XPress, Ventura, and Illustrator 88 to see how colors on the computer screen will look when printed out on a postscript raster image processor. One hundred plates of color samples, with screen percentages clearly marked and aligned, are arranged so that values progress toward the back of the book. Instructions for choosing colors are given. </p></div>
