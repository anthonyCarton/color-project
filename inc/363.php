London: George Allen & Unwin, 1960. 90 pp. Bibl., B/W illus., color illus. </p><p class="annot">The former director of the British Color Council contends thathuman comfort, efficiency, and productivity are affected by surroundings, and that the appropriate use of color and lighting can achieve an optimum working environment. He begins with a brief summary of color theories and phenomena, including a careful discussion of afterimage, and also considers color vision and color deficiencies. He summarizes information on color psychology and color preference, though his references to specific studies on color preference are not fully documented. The last half of the book provides recommendations for color and lighting applications in industry, business, hospitals, and schools. Both the Ostwald and Munsell notations are given, making it possible to replicate the recommended colors. While dated, this book is an excellent early example on this topic by a noted designer of English color systems whose practice and writings span the period from the 1930s through the 1950s. Readers may want to compare Wilsonâ€™s ideas to discussions of the same subjects by Faber Birren. </p></div>
