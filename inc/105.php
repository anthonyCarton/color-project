A short text introduces 100 pages of color standards. Each page shows one hue with four printed color samples, along with a few lines of text on the history, foreign synonyms, and horticultural examples. The first 64 colors are full hues arranged in a complete spectra] sequence; the remaining 36 are lighter, darker, or grayed versions of the full hues. This pioneering effort to standardize colors and color names for horticulture is revised and published regularly as the RHS Colour Chart. Since the standard is intended for matching and recording colors of horticultural materials, information for replicating the colors in paints or inks is not given. with four printed color samples, along with a few lines of text on the history, foreign synonyms, and horticultural examples.
