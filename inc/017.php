New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1961. 128 pp. Index, bibl., B/W illus., color illus.</p><p class="annot">Here Birren moves into the realm of the third dimension. Beginning with a Gestalt approach to visual perception, he explains shape constancy and illusion with reference to both two- and three-dimensional examples. The discussion of color and form addresses color association and meaning, creating satisfactory color schemes for three-dimensional works, the effect of lighting, and the phenomena of color constancy. He also makes suggestions for ‚”new expressions” in three-dimensional designs through incorporation of special effects such as luster, iridescence, luminosity, and transparency. Overall, the presentation is both incomplete and lacking in organization. Although brief and dated, the bibliography does include many of the classic titles in the area of visual perception.</p></div>
