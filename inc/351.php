ISBN 0-442-25953-0. </p><p class="annot">This “color reference” consists of a portfolio of colored renderingsof techniques and styles from the 1970s and early 1980s by students and professionals in architecture, landscape architecture, and interior and graphic design, a list of contents and a one-page preface. While the lack of explanation may not detract from the book’s value when it is used in connection with the author’s popular workshops, it is questionable whether the student or serious reader will be able to decipher or reproduce the techniques without an instructor or written guidance. </p></div>
