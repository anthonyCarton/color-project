<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">315. Casselman, Karen Leigh. Craft of the Dyer: Colour from Plants and Lichens of the Northeast. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1980. 249 pp. Index, bibl. ISBN 0-8020-2362-2. </p><p class="annot">An easy-to-read guide to contemporary and traditional dyeingmethods, this work indexes and describes 150 dye plants and lichens native to North America focusing on the region east of Manitoba and Minnesota and south to Virginia. The author includes a history of dyestuffs and documents her sources for techniques or devices shown in the book. The excellent bibliography surveys dye references from Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom. Twelve color photographs of yarns give a fine preview of color possibilities using natural dyes. The major shortcoming is the lack of illustrations of the plant materials to aid identification by beginning collectors. </p></div>
