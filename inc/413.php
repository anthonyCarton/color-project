Berkeley: Aaron Marcus and Associates, 1988. 111 pp. Bibl., endnotes/footnotes, B/W illus. </p><p class="annot">This publication compiles reference material for a SIGGRAPH (Special Interest Group for Graphics) workshop taught by Aaron Marcus and by Gerald Murch. The Notes cover physiology, perception, and cognitive and communications issues in relation to graphic design and computer graphics. Articles by Murch provide practical guidelines for effective use of color in graphics based on color and perception principles and recent experiments in the Tektronix laboratories. “Computer Color, Psychophysics, Task Application and Aesthetics” by Wanda Smith of Hewlett-Packard reports on psychophysical phenomena that affect human responses to computer displays: spatial effects, depth effects, interference effects, and color discrimination. The articles by leaders in the computer industry will be most useful to the reader with a technical background. Marcus’s emphasis on graphic design in both content and format may inspire the design reader to peruse the material. </p></div>
