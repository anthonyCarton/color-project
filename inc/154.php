New York: Harcourt-Brace. 1929. 287 pp. Index, endnotes/footnotes, glossary, B/W illus., color illus. </p><p class="annot">The author, a psychologist, develops a theory of color based onwhat she calls an “evolved color sense.” She opposes the theories of Hemholtz and Hering. Vision, color, and light are discussed in considerable detail. Most readers will find this book useful only as a historical curiosity that documents the thinking of a Columbia University lecturer whose career is described in the Preface as “long and belligerent.” </p></div>
