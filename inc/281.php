The premise of their book is that color is “central to successful appearance.” The range of live color types presented, all based on hair and skin color, includes dark and black skin colors. Core colors recommended for each type are organized into purse- sized color charts on the book jacket. A lively “Changing Images” section suggests color and dress for six different roles that women play in the workplace and after five. Lavish photographs enhance the brief and readable text. </p></div>
