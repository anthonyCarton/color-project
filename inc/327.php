<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">327. Millard, Debra. A Quilter"s Guide to Fabric Dyeing. Englewood, CO:1984. 36 pp. Bibl. </p><p class="annot">Debra Millard’s dye investigations for her master’s project at theUniversity of Minnesota form the basis for this book. Intended for the quiltmaker, it will be useful to anyone who wants to use Procion M-series dyes with cotton fabric. It is the first step-by-step dyeing guide written with the quiltmaker’s needs in mind. Nearly all the examples or formulas are either pure hues or hues desaturated with black or brown and formulas are illustrated with small fabric swatches. The dyeing of tints in gradations is described, but sample swatches of gradations are not included. Dyers will find Jan Myers’s method for dyeing gradations, described in her book Color Formulas for Use with Procion M-Series Dyes, easier to use. In fact, the two books are effectively used in tandem. A list of suppliers with addresses and a chart comparing color names by supplier are included. Fifteen of the 36 pages are blank grids to which readers can attach their own samples of dyed fabric. </p></div>
