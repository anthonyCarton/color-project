ISBN 0-03-060383-8. </p><p class="annot">This excellent text on designing costumes for the theater combinesconceptual material on costume design history, psychology of clothing, and color on the stage, with practical information on techniques for developing, sketching, and making costumes. Color is presented as a powerful design element that must be understood and carefully controlled because of its immediate impact on audiences. The “Color theory and Effects” chapter covers color characteristics and discusses Itten’s seven color contrasts. In reviewing color associations and symbolism, the authors note that audiences bring these associations with them to the theater and can be expected to react to colors in certain ways. Strategies for applying theoretical color information to productions are given, and the effect of colored light on fabric is also considered. The illustrations in the color chapter are taken from Itten’s Elements of Color. Excellent bibliographies on costume history and costume design add to the value of this book. The clear explanations of the interaction of color and light will be especially useful to students and practitioners. </p></div>
