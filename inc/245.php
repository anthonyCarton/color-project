New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1990. 248 pp. Index, bibl., glossary, appendices, B.W illus., color illus. ISBN 0-442- 3943 -6. </p><p class="annot">In place of the usual art elements and principles or skills-orientedapproach, Lazzari and Lee’s approach aims at developing cultural literacy and a heightened awareness of visual ideology. They define visual production as “the interaction of culture, objects, individuals, and institutions, in addition to the fabrication of objects.” Essentially, their narration follows a day in the life of a West Coast college student, presumably to appeal to the target audience. Within this scenario is an amazing play on sets of five in this tightly structured text. Each of the five chapters focuses on one of five major topics: perception, pattern, proportion, production, and power. Within each chapter are five sections “that reflect again the main topics of the book.” Five appendix sections cover topics that usually form the body of mainstream design books -- the visual system, composition, color, linear perspective, and drawing -- and also reflect the five major topics. For example, the color appendix briefly addresses: color and perception; the Munsell and CIE color systems; proportion; production and reproduction issues including computer and video; and the power of color. Conversely, the five main chapters also address the five appendix topics and include five assignments for students. The holistic approach combines theory, history, perception, and practice, which in turn are related to architecture, landscape, industrial and interior design, and traditional media. This ambitious text may be effectively used for a year-long foundations program.
