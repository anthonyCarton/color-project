ISBN 0-8306-3559-9. </p><p class="annot">The introduction in this informative text addresses the spectrum andvisible light, light primaries, colorants, subtractive mixing, the effect of texture and light, and color constancy. Six chapters cover the origins and sources of color, color properties, color “synchronicity,” color contrasts and effects, colorant mixing. Both the traditional hue circle and the CMYK Hue circle are included. Interesting discussions of hue, value, intensity, and temperature incorporate various meanings of the terms and suggest their interrelationships. Although the author does not acknowledge Itten anywhere, she presents color harmonics based on proportion and numerical ratios which she attributes to Goethe, suggesting that she is an Itten follower. Other detailed and also undocumented discussions of afterimages and of simultaneous contrast are confusing and contradictory. Six methods are given for reducing afterimages in designs are listed, while fourteen Chevreul’s laws of color contrast are illustrated. This text is enhanced by ten studio projects for each chapter that include exercises for mixing paint modulations or scales and matching colors. Shortcomings include the lack of bibliography, list of references, or documentation. </p></div>
