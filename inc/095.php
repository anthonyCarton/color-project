Washington, DC: GPO, 1976. 158 pp. Endnotes/footnotes, B/W illus., color illus. </p><p class="annot">The ISCC-NBS Method of Designating Colors and a Dictionary of Color Names by Kenneth L. Kelly and Deane B. Judd, and A Universal Color Language by Kenneth L. Kelly are combined in and superseded by this title. The authors advocate a standardized color language and discuss the origins, advantages, and applications of the Inter-Society Color Council -National Bureau of Standards method. Most of the book is a listing of ISCC-N BS color designators for synonymous and near-synonymous color names, arranged by hue, from 14 commonly used sources or systems, which makes it possible to find comparable colors from system to system. This book should be used in conjunction with the ISCC-NBS Color-Name Charts Illustrated with Centroid Colors, a supplement containing actual color chips for the 18 hue families (item 93). </p></div>
