<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">18. Birren, Faber. Functional Color. New York: Crimson, 1937. 124 pp. Index, bibl., B/W illus., color illus.</p><p class="annot">Birren’s concern here is with the use of color in industry, transportation, architecture, and interiors. The subtitle —”A Book of Facts and Research Meant to Inspire More Rational Methods in the Solution of Color Problems”-- indicates the scope of this book. The visual and emotional aspects of color are addressed, but no documentation is provided. This very dated book is nevertheless interesting as a record of the color options available to businesses in the 1930s and as a document of the early work of a prolific writer of popular books on color use.</p></div>
