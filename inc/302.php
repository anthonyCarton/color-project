First, color theory fundamentals are discussed with emphasis on Chevreul and afterimages. Then a section on color perception in weaving explains why woven color acts differently from painted color and tells how to predict what will happen when two colors are woven together. A helpful reference chart of color combinations and their effects on each other is included. The remainder of the book consists of detailed instructions for color exercises with discussions of the results, although there is no explanation of why colors change. Detailed instructions for weaving color samplers of primary secondary, and neutral colors and a color blanket that serves the same purpose as a hue circle. Forty-three color plates illustrate the exercises and woven objects that demonstrate the application of color principles. </p></div>
