<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">258. Scott, Robert Gillam. Design Fundamentals. New York: McGraw, 1951.199 pp. Index, bibl., B/W illus., color illus. </p><p class="annot">Within the context of subtractive color and paint, Scott discusseshow to change “tonal dimensions” of hue, value and intensity by mixing a pigment with black, white, gray, or another pigment. His survey of ways that colors are influenced by their environment includes simultaneous contrast, wami/cool contrast, and value contrast. In a third chapter he presents methods for achieving unified color relationships through hue and value sequences and gradations; use of analogous, triad, or complementary intervals; and dominant hue or temperature. Short reading lists, now very dated, conclude each chapter. While Scott fails to provide a comprehensive overview of color theory, some readers may find his color strategies of interest. A fine example of a design text of the 1950s, special features of the book include coverage of three-dimensional design and the role of proportion in design. </p></div>
