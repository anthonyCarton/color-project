<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">408. Mahnke, Frank H., Rudolf H. Mahnke. Color, Environment, and Human Response. An Interdisciplinary Understanding of Color and its Use as a Beneficial Element in the Design of the Architectural Enviroment. New York: John Wiley 1996. 234 pp. Index, bibl., B/W illus, color illus. ISBN 0-471-28667-2 </p><p class="annot">In the first of two main parts, the author discusses factorsthat influence human response in the environment, indoors and outdoor. He offers research based information that should be useful to a wide range of professionals, including those who make color decisions for schools and hospitals. In the second part he provides information on what he calls color fundamentals. In sixteen chapters he discusses the nature of color, psychophysiological effects of color, color associations, vision and light, and offers specific guidelines for use of color in offices, hospitals and mental health hospitals, industrial work environments, schools, food and food service, and color for exteriors. Sixteen pages of color plates with 42 photos with captions are bound in the center of the book, far from the discussions. The photos are of color designed interiors and exteriors in Europe or the American West where Mahnke maintained a color design studio. The interesting unannotated bibliography includes 148 items published through 1994, including references to the work of Heinrich Frieling in German, and many journal articles. Color and Light in Man- Made Environments, published by the same authors in 1987, anticipates much in this book. </p></div>
