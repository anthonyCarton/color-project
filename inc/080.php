<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">80. Rossotti, Hazel. Colour. New York: Penguin, 1983. 239 pp. Index, B/W illus. </p><p class="annot">The author, whose background is in chemistry, writes about color inthe natural world, and color vision in humans and animals. Color systems are explained within the context of sorting and organizing color. Examples are given of additive color such as color television, and subtractive color such as paints and dyes, and color symbolism is described. The most obvious shortcoming of this paper back is the lack of illustrations and color plates. </p></div>
