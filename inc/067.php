San Francisco: Exploratorium, 1980. 169 pp. B/W illus., color illus. </p><p class="annot">Designed to explain to visitors the phenomena that are demonstratedin the fascinating exhibits on view in the Exploratoriumâ€™s Light and Color area, this book can also be used independently. Neat line drawings and photographs supplement an easy-to-read text that covers a broad range of color, light, and visual perception facts. Lack of an index, the use of a casual first-person writing style, and regular references to the displays may frustrate readers who are unable to see the actual exhibitions. </p></div>
