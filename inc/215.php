ISBN 289-27662-4. </p><p class="annot">Because Schwarz believes that a discussion of color from a scientificviewpoint is of limited use to the artist, he provides a minimum of such information. Instead, he emphasizes color use as a means of personal expression, relying on examples from and allusions to nature and master artists. Though brief, the information on color science, theories, and systems is accurately and well-presented. Those interested in paint and painting will find the chapter on pigments and techniques helpful. </p></div>
