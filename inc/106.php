ISBN: 0-87773-524-7. </p><p class="annot">This highly readable color history spans a “territory with raggedborders located somewhere between the sciences and the arts, between physics and psychology, a land whose configuration constitutes a border between two diverse cultures.” Both cultures figure in this story of the development of color theory, which tells how dyes and pigments were made and discusses their social context. In a chapter on “Color as Figure and Fate,” the way color in dress is imbued with meaning is illustrated by the triumph of black garb in Reformation societies. The “Color and Forms” chapter describes the formularies that preserved the knowledge of dyes, paints, and craft substances from ancient workshops that inspired the 19th- century reemergence of historic crafts that culminated in William Morris and Mariano Fortuny fabrics. The many engaging color concepts and well- integrated references to the innovative ideas of Newton, Cennini, Voltaire, Goethe, Delacroix, Kandinsky, Wittgenstein, Friehling, Kueppers, and others, enhance this work. The statement that Thomas Young (1773-1829) took his lead from Hermann von Helmholtz needs correction since von Helmholtz was not born until 1821. The useful chapter notes and the unannotated bibliography of 150 items offer access to the international color literature. The lack of colored illustrations, with the exception of the cover, is regrettable. </p></div>
