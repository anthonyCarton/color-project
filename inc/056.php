<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">56. Taylor, F. A. Color Technology. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1962. 140 pp. Index, bibl., B/W illus., color illus. </p><p class="annot">This book is intended to explain the science and technology of colorto the layperson and to provide a guide for art, craft, and industrial design practitioners. Clear and thorough accounts are provided of the physical and chemical aspects of color agents, the physiological relationship between color and vision, and the psychological influences of color such as color preference and symbolism. Discussions of the hue circle, color harmony, and “regular progression of color” or predetermined color sequences are included. Although this work is frequently cited in bibliographies, Taylor is also known for his translation of Wilhelm Ostwald’s Colour Science (1931). Some of his opinionated statements make us wince today, for example: “the human male is biologically and psychologically more finely balanced than the female.” Another weakness lies in the poor quality of the color illustrations, which do not successfully illustrate the points being made. </p></div>
