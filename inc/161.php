<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">161. Riordan, James L. The Dynamics of Color Control and Harmonies. New York: Vantage, 1970. 75 pp. B/W illus., color illus. </p><p class="annot">This basic introduction to color begins with a consideration of fourcomponents of color: hue, value, chroma, and intensity. In the context of subtractive color or paint, the author states that chroma changes occur when a hue is mixed with its complement. Intensity changes occur when a hue is mixed with varying amounts of a gray whose value is the same as the hue. The author uses the concept of dynamic symmetry to achieve harmonious color and believes that his theories work in practice even though they do not conform to current, generally accepted theories. The value of this dated book is as a document of a personal approach from the period or as a curiosity. </p></div>
