New York: Reinhold, 1971. 274 pp. Index, B/W illus., color illus. </p><p class="annot">This edition brings together the color theories, observations, andnotes of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, the 19th century poet and Renaissance man. Goethe was deeply interested in and wrote about psychological effects of color, and also carefully recorded his observations of color phenomena such as “demanded” or negative afterimage colors and the colors of shadows. This volume contains a complete facsimile edition of Charles Eastlake’s 1880 translation of Goethe’s “Didactic Part” of The Color Theory. Marginal explanatory notes by Matthaei are useful. The greatest strength of this edition is its completeness and the many handsome color plates, including those that document Goethe’s experiments. While this book is invaluable for those who want to delve into Goethe’s color studies, some may find it difficult and long. </p></div>
