<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">459. Beaumont, Michael. Type & Colour. Oxford: Phaidon, 1987. 144 pp. Index, glossary, B/W illus., color illus. ISBN 0-7148-2489-5. </p><p class="annot">Two major elements of graphic design, type and color, are clearly explained through brief text and more than 400 illustrations selected from top British and American design studios. Typography is addressed first, with an emphasis on type face choice and layout to achieve innovative designs. Then the importance of color in typography and background is clearly discussed with an emphasis on human response to color. Examples of both successful and less satisfactory color design are given. This beautifully designed book, with its abundance of both black-and-white and color illustrations, will be useful to graphic design students and professionals. </p></div>
