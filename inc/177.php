ISBN 0-442-24038-4. </p><p class="annot">Written by a Bauhaus master who developed the basic course onform and color, this condensed but thorough student-text version of Itten’s major work, The Art of Color, examines color usage by artists and discusses three ways to approach color: visually, emotionally, and symbolically. Itten uses the physics of color to lay the groundwork for understanding color effects and describes and illustrates seven color contrasts of hue, light-dark, cold-warm, complementary, simultaneous, saturation, and extension. His error in attributing Schopenhauer’s ideas on proportion to Goethe subsequently reappears in work based on Itten such as Mante’s Color Design in Photography and McKelvey’s Color for Quilters. This edition is easy to follow and understand. </p></div>
