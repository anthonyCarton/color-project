<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib special">173. De Grandis, Luigina. Theory and Use of Color. Translated by John Gilbert. New York: Abrams, 1986. 159 pp. Index, bibl., B/W illus., color illus. ISBN 0-8109-2317-3. </p><p class="annot">This Italian artist-teacher’s “complete panorama of the variousaspects under which color can be considered” is a very thorough and readable compendium of important topics. After an introduction to color as light, a definitive color theory chapter reviews luminosity, warm and cool, value and lightness, saturation and intensity, and much more. The brief discussion of major color systems leads to an explanation of Alfred Hickethier’s CYMK color system that will be valuable to those interested in color printing because Hickethier’s system rarely appears in American publications. Careful attention is given to the objective and subjective nature of color in chapters on physical and chemical factors, psychophysical parameters, and painting techniques and practices. A strong emphasis on the “The Visual Apparatus” includes several theories of color vision and the CIE triangle. Discussions of lighting conditions, perception, and color equilibrium -- which explore successive and simultaneous contrast and harmony -- round out the book. De Grandis credits some of her sources and includes several European color authorities in her selected 29 item bibliography, for example, including Heinrich Friehling. The beautifully printed color plates, many by her students, and illustrations of examples from art and design are well located adjacent to explanatory text. While intended to serve as a reference and handbook rather than as a text, the lack of specific student exercises may be viewed as a shortcoming by teachers. </p></div>
