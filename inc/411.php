ISBN 0-12-225210-1. </p><p class="annot">Written by experts in the field, these essays focus on the coding of text and images using color, rather than on the presentation of images in color. The collection begins with fundamental information on the capabilities and limitations of display systems and of the people who process and respond to the information. Color science and perception are discussed as they relate to color displays. A large portion of the book deals with color applications in the military, medicine, cartography, business, and other fields. A research methodology is provided and specific guidelines are based on actual usage. A bibliography follows each essay. Readers will find it useful to have some previous knowledge of color science and perception. </p></div>
