<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">156. Marx, Ellen. The Contrast of Colors. New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1973. 208 pp. Color illus. ISBN 0-442-25114-9. </p><p class="annot">This spiral-bound book presents a fine collection of full page visualsthat demonstrate color relativity and the interaction of colors through examples of relative contrast of complements, simultaneous effects, brightness, saturation, quantity, and hot and cold color associations. Some pages are designed with die-cut openings or transparent overlays that enable the reader to observe and manipulate color relationships. The explanatory notes are minimal, so the book requires a fundamental understanding of color theory to follow the examples. The excellent quality of the illustrations makes this a fine supplement to more general books. </p></div>
