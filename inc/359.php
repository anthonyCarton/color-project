The text leads students to understand and visualize space through firsthand experience with the spatial variables of light, surface, shape and form. Major sections on the history of spatial representation examine sensations of space, spatial elements, spatial codes, simulating real space, perceptual-psychological space, Gestalt perception principles, and depth perception clues in pictorial space. The author maintains that we experience each of the spatial elements as a component of all the others, so that color is texture and form, and provides several student exercises to test his thesis. The first consists of mixing-to-match an observed form and recording the color nuances in a color scale. Next is a color wheel project that starts with red and its bluish-green afterimage, creates a subtractive color circle based on red green and blue yellow opposites, intermixes red and green paint to test subtractive color saturation, and finally suggests experiments with additive light primaries. Further explanations and black and white diagrams show a color model with hue, saturation (or chroma), and brightness (or value); a hue circle with wavelengths of light for its 10 hues; and several historic color models. Another project involves drawings of texture and color gradients arranged into three-dimensional floorscape and wall-scape relationships. Relevant research findings appear throughout this work. The lack of color plates is the only shortcoming of this superb book, which should appeal to design educators interested in three-dimensional design and color experience. </p></div>
