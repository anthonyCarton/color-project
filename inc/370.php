The Munsell and Ostwald systems are explained and illustrated, as are color characteristics and the standard color harmonies. Detailed information on paint mixing and matching, paint use in interiors and exteriors, and the impact of lighting and reflections on color appearance is intended for professional house painters but may also be useful to design professionals and home-owners. </p></div>
