<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">490. Hattersley, Ralph. Beginner’s Guide to Color Photography. Garden City, NY, Doubleday, 1979. 223 pp., B/W illus., color illus. </p><p class="annot">This comprehensive book introduces beginners to a range of basic technical topics like film, matching film to colors of light, exposure, and color printing. In the beginning chapter on “where color comes from” the reader is asked to think of color as light. The concise but understandable discussion of color cleverly integrates explanations of additive color, how the colorant primaries of magenta, cyan and yellow subtract certain colors from the light that falls upon them, and how color filters work. Diagrams show the light primaries of red, blue and green. The subtractive color wheel features the opposites used in color printing of green and magenta, cyan and red, and yellow and blue. The concluding chapters challenge the beginner with thought provoking questions on composition, intent, and judging one’s own pictures. </p></div>
