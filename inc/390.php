<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib special">390. Hobhouse, Penelope. Colour in Your Garden. London: Wm. Collins, 1985. 240 pp. Bibl., color illus. ISBN 0-00-217142-2. </p><p class="annot">This is a comprehensive and lavishly illustrated work. Following areview of basic color theory and the “natural order of color” approach (which may derive from H. Barrett Carpenter), fully half of the book illustrates garden plants organized into hue families: clear yellows, blues, pinks and mauves, strong reds, and foliage greens. A chart reminiscent of Chevreul shows simultaneous contrast effects. Hobhouse, also the author of Gertrude Jekyll on Gardening (1983), weaves some interesting documentation into her text. For example, she states that Faber Birren’s 1974 edition of The Student Handbook of Color omits Ogden Rood’s text on garden color. This beautifully designed book will inspire the general reader as well as gardeners and design professionals. </p></div>
