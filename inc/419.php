<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">419. Biggs, Emest. Colour in Advertising. London: Studio Vista, 1956. 160 pp. Index, bibl., B/W illus., color illus. </p><p class="annot">The book is based on the premise that a greater awareness of color will result in better and more thoughtful use of color in advertising. After a brief discussion of human response to color, Biggs provides general information on advertising and then looks at the role of color in communicating ideas. Individual chapters are devoted to packaging, print advertisements and materials, posters, film, and television. The chapter on export advertising comments briefly on color preferences and associations in foreign countries. The discussion of standardization focuses on the Ostwald color system, and a six-page summary highlights the main points in each chapter. The broad scope of this book makes it an excellent historic resource on the topic. Unfortunately, no recent publications cover the topic as thoroughly. </p></div>
