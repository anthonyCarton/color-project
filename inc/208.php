<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">208. Fletcher, Frank Morley. Colour Control. London: Faber and Faber, 1936. 79 pp. Index, B/W illus. </p><p class="annot">Fletcher relates his color theories and color notation ideas, which are based on correspondences between constructing keys in music theory and color intervals, and gives practical suggestions for creating a restricted palette that is organized and controlled. He refers to the Edinburgh system of color intervals and the work of Hugh Cameron to record the “note” of colors by stating their hue, intensity, and pitch. This work may be of historic interest to those concerned with links between art and music or to those who have discovered Tinker’s conceptual but practical color cylinder based on Fletcher’ work. </p></div>
