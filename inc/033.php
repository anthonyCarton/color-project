New York: McGraw-Hill, 1950. 284 pp. Index, bibl., B/W illus.</p><p class="annot">In this early work on the pseudoscientific and pseudomedical issue of color therapy, Birren brings together the research data on this subject and appeals to the scientific and medical communities to abandon old prejudices and give the beneficial effects of color a fair appraisal. A historical review of color mysticism and symbolism is followed by information on the biological, psychological and visual aspects of color. Birren includes a bibliography of significant works on therapeutic and psychological aspects of color but does not provide specific documentation throughout the text.</p></div>
