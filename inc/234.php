New York: Macmillan, 1954. 515 pp. Index, B/W illus. color illus. </p><p class="annot">This book is a study of the application of the fundamental principlesof design and color by two University of Minnesota professors who fostered the non-elitist art in daily life movement in America from the 1920s through the 1950s. Readers with an interest in the history of design education and the development of design texts will enjoy the Goldsteins as they discuss everything from selecting and arranging pictures and flowers to the requirements for proper clothing and a good house plan. The authors focus on harmony, proportion, balance, rhythm, emphasis, and “good taste,” particularly in the realms of dress, interior design, and housing. The two color chapters, one dealing with theory and the other with application, explain the Prang and Munsell color systems, color characteristics, and the psychologists’ and physicists’ primaries. They also discuss color use with reference to balance, repetition, “keying” to one hue, and the standard color harmonies. The value of this book now is mainly as an innovative example and record of the interests and concerns of its time. Photographs, many by the authors, supplement the text. </p></div>
