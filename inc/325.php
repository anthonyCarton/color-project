ISBN 0442-2958-7. </p><p class="annot">Arctic plants are the subject of this dye manual,which was inspiredby the authorâ€™s teaching experience in Spence Bay, Canada, where she organized a summer-long workshop for 32 Inuit women who collected and tested many local dye plant materials and eventually set up a cottage industry. Technical information on these Arctic dye stuffs is divided into 17 basic methods that can be used with all natural dye materials. This neatly organized book -- with its 13 color plates, index of lichens and plants by botanical and common names, index of plants by color, instructions for making a dye record book, and model color palette made with naturally dyed fibers -- will inspire natural dyers. </p></div>
