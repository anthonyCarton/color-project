ISBN 0-8230-2469-5.</p><p class="annot">Stern explains that most beginners paint not what the eye sees butwhat the mind lets the eye see. That is, they paint what they expect to see. Using the “color spot” approach, which he claims is based on the methods of great masters of oil painting, he presents 22 still-life studies to teach identification, mixing, and painting of color spots. Students work on a series of three studies, each leading to more refined color sense, to develop a greater understanding of object color as it is affected by light sources and atmospheric perspective. This specialized book has little background information on color beyond a list of eight oil paint tube colors and a black- and-white picture of a twelve hue color wheel with a sentence on mixing the relevant colors. Nevertheless, the diligent student could learn about color and how it is perceived by working through the lessons. </p></div>
