London: Kegan Paul, 1935. 300 pp. Index, endnotes/footnotes, glossary, B/W illus. </p><p class="annot">Color perception and color constancy, of primary concern to Katz,are introduced in relation to the appearance of color and illumination. Both subjective and surface color are considered. A classic and much-cited work, this book is scholarly and well-documented, though there are few illustrations. The writing style is formal, perhaps the result of translation from the German. </p></div>
