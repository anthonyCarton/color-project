<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib special">113. Birren, Faber. History of Color in Painting. New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1965. 304 pp. Index, B/W illus., color illus. ISBN 0-442-11118-5. </p><p class="annot">The expressive use of color in painting in Western art from ancient times to the 20th century is the focus of this book which begins with a brief discussion of color theory and gives consideration to various approaches to color harmony, color systems and color relativity, and finally, color perception. Nearly one-half of the book examines the work of selected great artists from the 17th through the 20th century, surveys their palettes and pigments, and presents tipped-in color chips that represent the palettes. There is some repetition because palettes and techniques for several artists are discussed both in the early chapter on methods and in the later chapters on historical references. This fine survey may be Birren’s most important and lasting contribution to the color literature. </p></div>
