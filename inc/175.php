New York: McGraw-Hill, 1952. 206 pp. Index, endnotes/footnotes, B/W illus., color illus. </p><p class="annot">The author revised and expanded the color chapters in his earlier ArtOf Color and Design (1951) to create this more comprehensive and integrated approach to color. The section on color sensation includes information on color vision as well as on the psychology of color, color symbolism, and even color hearing. Color blindness, optical illusions, and afterimages are treated as modifiers of color sensation. His color organization is based upon the Munsell color system. This bookâ€™s current usefulness is primarily as an example of color study in the 1950s. </p></div>
