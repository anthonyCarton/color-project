<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">70. Hurvich, Leo M. Color Vision. Sunderland, MA: Sinauer Associates, 1981. 328 pp. Index, endnotes/footnotes, color illus. ISBN 0-87893- 336-0. </p><p class="annot">This authoritative and well-written text on the physiology of colorvision includes many discussions that will be useful to the design reader. Chapters on “Spatial Contrast and Assimilation Effects” and “Temporal Contrast Effects” describe ways in which the physiological phenomena of afterimages and simultaneous contrast constantly affect our vision and how these phenomena are utilized by light sciences (e.g, photography). Other interesting and well-illustrated discussions cover achromatic and chromatic simultaneous contrast effects; afterimage; Pointillist color mixture; additive and subtractive color mixture; assimilation effects; a 16-hue circle based on four unique hues or “primaries”; and a concluding chapter on color reproduction, photography, printing, television and painting. While the book does not presuppose prior knowledge, it develops its explanations quite technically and is geared toward the advanced reader who approaches color science from a physiological or human perception standpoint. </p></div>
