ISBN 0-8230-0757-X. </p><p class="annot">This excellent overview of color theory has far more general appealthan the title implies. Actually intended as a practical guide, it begins with a detailed explanation of color and light, a definition of the properties of color, and illustrations of additive and subtractive color mixing. Considerable attention is given to complementary hues, simultaneous contrast, and other color phenomena such as fluting, vibrating boundaries, and optical mixing. Throughout the book are shapes to be filled in using designated watercolors, though no instruction on the use of watercolor or any other paint medium is provided. Those interested in learning about color could use this excellent workbook for independent study. </p></div>
