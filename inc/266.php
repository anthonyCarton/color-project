ISBN 0-13-917493-1. </p><p class="annot">This text examines “the purposes, language, history and media ofthe visual arts.” The author includes crafts and design in his art continuum. In 11 pages devoted to color in the language of an section, the author touches on the temperature, emotional and cultural associations, and spatial properties of color and illustrates the power of color in the work of expert painters. A 14 page essay in the painting chapter moves from light and color to enjoying color. The usual discussion of color mechanics is sidestepped in favor of the meaning and mystery of color in art. The author urges the reader to see in opulent and rich color the principle of psychic comfort, and to observe in tonal and color gradations the principle of color movement. The author’s great affection for the arts comes through in this beautifully illustrated and elegantly written in-depth treatment of the arts that deftly combines art appreciation with art history. </p></div>
