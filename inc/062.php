New York: St. Martinâ€™s, 1971. 208 pp. Bibl., glossary, B/W illus., color illus. </p><p class="annot">Originally published in Dutch in 1945, this introduction to thescientific study of color stimuli and sensation begins with a discussion of color, light, and physiology. It surveys brightness, luminance, the color triangle, color space, the CIE system, colorimetry, visual inspections of color samples, and defects in color vision. A history of the development of color science is followed by information on color differences and characteristics of color sensation. Practical applications focus on artificial daylight, signals, and, of special interest to the design reader, color reproduction, television, and photography. Much of the information is very technical, but the chapter on the historic development of color science is readable. </p></div>
