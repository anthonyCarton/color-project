<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">171. Bradley, Milton. Elementary Color. Springfield, MA: Milton Bradley Co., 1895. 1288 pp. B/W illus., color illus. </p><p class="annot">Bradley was part of an American educational reform movement thatbelieved art education should be sequential and build on previously acquired knowledge. Consequently, this small book for elementary teachers and advanced students provides basic information, a simple nomenclature for standard colors, and a color system based on the Maxwell wheel. Much of the book is devoted to practical experiments and a discussion of teaching color in the schoolroom. The Milton Bradley Company marketed school art supplies and produced teaching aids including color wheels, prisms, scales, charts, and books a decade before the Munsell Company became active. This work is of interest for its historic view. </p></div>
