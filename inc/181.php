ISBN 0-8120-2173-8. </p><p class="annot">The author intends this reference, based on color as perceivedsensation and supported by scientific facts, for educators and practitioners in applied art areas from art education to his own field of printing reproduction technology. Compared with his Color; Origin, Systems, Uses (1972), here Kueppers combines a briefer discussion of perception principles and color relationships with practical instructions for classroom teaching. Helpful explanations cover the relativity of color perception, the interaction of light waves and the human eye, and the Kueppers rhombohedron color solid. Though the mathematical models of color relationships may be rather obscure to some readers, the abundant illustrations help clarify difficult concepts. The section on the role of color in art and design is brief but useful. Instructors and advanced students interested in color technology will enjoy this thorough approach. The 15- item bibliography is annotated and a list of suppliers for teaching aids is included. </p></div>
