Unlike more prescriptive approaches, the text allows for the intuitive as well as for deliberate planning in the creative process and encourages individual interpretation. Each concept is introduced, illustrated, and followed by a critique section with thought-provoking questions. The discussions of judging color in context and of creating space and volume through color deserve special attention. Although primarily illustrated with the artist’s watercolors, the book includes the work of many other leading contemporary watercolorists, with some paintings shown in developmental stages. The author’s vigorous painting approach and his straightforward writing style combine well in this splendid book on the creative process.</p></div>
