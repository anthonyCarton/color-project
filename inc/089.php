ISBN 0-8109-3711-5. </p><p class="annot">Various Pantone® Matching Systems are used for specifying colorsfor graphic design, printing, textiles, apparel, home furnishing, and in interior and architectural design. The publication of the colors in this book format is especially useful now that Pantone® is the color communication standard of choice in the electronic environment as well. The text by Leatrice Eiseman includes basic color terminology, color concepts, and color mixing principles, and proposes general guidelines for combining colors in varying contexts in reference to a traditional 12-hue color circle. A list of positive and negative word associations for 38 colors and a color name index are provided, although undocumented. The 31-page text is followed by color samples attributed to Lawrence Herbert. Each of the 1,024 color swatches on 127 pages is identified by number and by name in English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, and Spanish. Curiously, information on organization of the Pantone® cylinder is lacking here. For a b/w diagram that shows the cylinder with 64 hues and 10 reflectance levels see the Pantone ® Professional Color System; Color Guide for Architecture, Interiors, Fashion and Beauty (1989). </p></div>
