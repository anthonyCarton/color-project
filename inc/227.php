ISBN 0- 13-201947-7. </p><p class="annot">“Visual aesthetic design,” as the appropriate combination of unityand variety, and “context” are the major themes in this text on two- and three-dimensional design. The “Color and Context ” chapter at the beginning of the book contrasts the traditional treatment of visual elements and principles with a more holistic, contextual approach. The author briefly discusses color characteristics, color as accent, conventional color schemes, and color relativity. The two main recommended means of modifying color recommended are pigment mixture and simultaneous contrast. Since he describes but does not explain the latter and dismisses successive contrast as of little importance in art, readers who want explanations of color perception will need to look elsewhere. The “context” of design history, theory, and creativity is woven into “Composition and Gestalt,” “ Pictures and Patterns,” and “Vision and Invention” chapters. The lively text is supported by 20 sample exercises, which are presented as puzzles for students, and many illustrations that include student work. Marginal notes and quotations, and a 73-item bibliography with short annotations are other interesting features. </p></div>
