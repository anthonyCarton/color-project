The introductory overview examines a range of topics, including child art and folk art, visual perception and right brain dominance, and themes and purposes of art. The visual elements chapter includes a concise discussion of light and color on 12 beautifully illustrated pages that cover light, psychological and physiological effects of color, color theory, color properties, color pigment, color harmonies, optical effects of color, afterimages, and emotional qualities of color. A section on graphic design as communication is illustrated with many excellent examples from advertising, print and electronic media.
