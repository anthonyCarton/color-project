ISBN 0-442-27672-9. </p><p class="annot">This outstanding work starts with a survey of the history of color inEnglish architectural drawing. Then historic precedents in architectural illustration and the fine arts are related to discussions of planning concepts and color principles. Chapters on color attributes review and illustrate hue, value, and chroma from an architectural viewpoint, and thoroughly cover atmospheric color and light and environmental or seasonal color. The handsome illustrations for these sections are by Richard Rochon. The concluding third of the book features statements and work by 11 contemporary illustrators who represent a range of styles. The compelling, well-organized text and the many superb illustrations make this an exemplary design book for color instructors, students, and practitioners. Illustrators in other design areas will find much useful information on color dynamics in the design process. </p></div>
