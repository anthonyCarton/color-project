ISBN: 0-8138-1227-5. </p><p class="annot">This text intended for college students thoroughly covers newspaper layout and design in chapters on page layout, use of type and photographs, information graphics, design, and color. The design chapter gives special emphasis to the principles of balance, contrast, focus, proportion, and unity. The brief “Communicating with Color” chapter presents the findings of research studies on reader response to newspaper color, including the 1986 Poynter Institute study by Garcia and Fry. Discussions of basic color terms, how color is produced in newspapers, color theory with black-and- white diagrams of the traditional 12-hue circle, and producing quality color complete the brief chapter. Unlike many textbooks, this one uses interesting documentation from a broad range of references to enrich the text. Some readers will wish to consult another work that illustrates hands- on methods and industrial processes more fully. The printing methods and soft paper used in this publication result in an unfortunate loss of crispness and detail in the numerous black-and-white illustrations. </p></div>
