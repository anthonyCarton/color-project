ISBN: 0- 13- 15 1259-5. </p><p class="annot">This fine reference offers a concise yet understandable overview ofessential topics: color physics; additive color relationships; pigment colors and the traditional 12 hue circle; saturation, hue and value according to Munsell; color perception; psychological effects of color; color symbolism; personal color preference; and color expression. Color is discussed from a design point of view as it relates to balance and proportion, emphasis, and unity in composition. Historic color theories are traced from Leonardo Da Vinci, Newton, Moses Harris and Goethe to Runge, Chevreul, Rood, Munsell and Ostwald. Color mixing principles and notation are related to dyes, pigments, ceramic glazes, color printing, and color photography. Other chapters cover light mixtures in the electronic environment and color combinations and interactions. The history of color in painting, and color application in the fine arts and in the applied design fields are illustrated with American, English, and continental examples. The careful placement of the excellent color illustrations within the relevant discussions in the text is the highly commendable achievement of the English book designer and color printing in Singapore. Zelanski (a student of Albers) and Fisher back up their superb overview with informative chapter notes and a glossary. While this is a general reference for artists and art students in all media, a list of recommended student problems is available separately. </p></div>
