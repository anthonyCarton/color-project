<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">328. Myers, Jan. Color Formulas for Use with Procion M-Series Dyes. Minneapolis, 1986. l0 pp. </p><p class="annot">Myers began developing her dye formulas while a graduate studentat the University of Minnesota. In this workbook of dye formulas she uses Procion M-series dyes to create 30 colors, each with eight value gradations. Step-by-step instructions for dyeing cotton fabric are provided. The book’s strength lies in the specific formulas, all illustrated with actual fabric swatches. By desaturating with hues in addition to black and brown, Myers creates more varied colors than Millard does in her Quilter’s Guide to Fabric Dyeing. However, the formula approach is also a weakness because it does not provide a context, other than experimentation, for creating other colors; there is no reference to color theory nor alternative approaches to desaturation. (Readers wanting this information can turn to Millard’s A Quilter’s Guide to Fabric Dyeing and Knutson’s Synthetic Dyes and Natural Fibers.) Myers, a quilt artist well known for using gradation, clearly explains her method for creating graded value steps. Also included are a list of suppliers and a comparative chart that gives dye names and numbers by supplier.</p></div>
