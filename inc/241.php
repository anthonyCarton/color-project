<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">241. Kepes, Gyorgy. Language of Vision. Chicago: Paul Theobald, 1944. 228pp. B/W illus., color illus. </p><p class="annot">This pioneering work introduced generations of American designstudents to Gestalt concepts related to art and design. As he describes the development of visual representation and the evolution of design in the 20th century, Kepes simultaneously formulates a new vocabulary for art education and leads the viewer to experience new modes of perception. Discussions of design, color, and perception principles are integrated throughout this design classic authored by this master of the light workshop at the new Bauhaus in Chicago who later went on to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. </p></div>
