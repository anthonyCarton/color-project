ISBN 0-442- 29284-8. </p><p class="annot">Wong, who has written texts on two- and three-dimensional design,now addresses color and design basics. Rather than follow a single color system he credits Goethe for the six hue circle that features red on top, and “echoes” Munsell theories in the analyses in the text. A quarter of the books consists of general two-dimensional design concepts with black-and-white plates. He then discusses some common terms and principles of color design. He uses the terms “high, medium and low key” rather than the more standard “light, medium and dark value,” but the accompanying illustration fails to explain his point, and the related figures 87 and 88 seem to be reversed. Important ideas such as color harmony and simultaneous contrast here merit only two pages of discussion. In the color design section, examples of color relationships are often shown as central figures on dark or black grounds. The many illustrations by his students are reduced to 2-5/8” and I-1/8” squares, which makes it difficult to see clearly all of the described relationships. In summary, the text is too brief, the illustrations too small, and the shapes generally too complex to present the color principles clearly. However, the color design section outlines a number of specific strategies such as value gradation, chroma gradation, hue gradation, and hue mixtures, which makes this text more helpful than most in this respect. Those seeking information on practical application for color design beyond the classroom will need to look elsewhere. </p></div>
