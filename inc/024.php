Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1970. 192 pp. Index, bibl., B/W illus., color illus.</p><p class="annot">This ophthalmologist considers the human personality as a reflection of both how well and in what way we see, and defines art as the outward expression of the personality. He examines the creative work and activities of 50 renowned artists, composers, writers, poets, philosophers and historic figures. His analysis of the influences of blunted sight brought about by myopia, presbyopia, cataract, and other conditions focusses on the creative production of 17 visual artists. Other topics include the optical basis of vision, color and temperament, the influence of environmental color, therapeutic use of color, and influence on painting of natural eye pigments. Roughly a quarter of this fascinating and beautifully illustrated book discusses color. Detailed notes and a 198-item bibliography further enhance this work.</p></div>
