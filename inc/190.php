London: Winsor & Newton, 1935. 168 pp. B/W illus., color illus. </p><p class="annot">This course of study is based on the premise that color isfundamental and should be studied from an early age following a cohesive, graded plan. Through 27 steps, the student progresses from simple exercises in recognizing and talking about color to more complex lessons on contrasts, harmony, and gradation. The second volume deals with color usage, controlling contrast, and color harmony. The approach, with its “rational combination of Science and Art” is based on Wilhelm Ostwald’s Color Science. The exercises are dated and prescriptive. Still, the influence of color science on teaching about color to children may attract the interested reader. </p></div>
