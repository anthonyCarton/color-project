New York: Whitney Library of Design, 1963. 200 pp. Index, B/W illus., color illus. </p><p class="annot">This informally written survey of color in interiors begins with a cursory, undocumented historic overview followed by Birren’s theory of “modern” color use in buildings. His recommendations are now dated and the information is less detailed than in his New Horizons in Color (1960) and Light, Color, and Environment (1988), which cover some of the same ground. Students of historical color usage will find useful the ll pages of color charts with chips that record selective color palettes from ancient Egypt to 1950s America. Five other charts recommend color palettes for hospitals, industrial plants, offices, schools, and food services. </p></div>
