Cambridge: Massachusetts Institute of Technology Press, 1986. 179 pp. Endnotes/footnotes, B/W illus., color illus. ISBN 0-262-07110-2. </p><p class="annot">This book continues the personal and idiosyncratic investigationsGerstner chronicled in The Spirit of Colors. He cites the work of Philipp Otto Runge, Gunter Wyszecki, Wilhelm Ostwald, Hans Hinterreiter, and Wassily Kandinsky in an overview. He examines systems of forms to determine their structural interrelatedness and pays particular attention to the Alhambra and other Islamic geometric patterns as he looks at the vital interaction between color and form. This inspiring, beautifully designed and illustrated book is more meaningful when viewed from a knowledge of the history and application of color theory. Gerstner concludes the book with his own computer-assisted works, for which he used Kandinsky’s “Color Signs” as a model. </p></div>
