East Lansing: Michigan State University Press, 1969. 222 pp. Index, bibl., endnotes/footnotes. </p><p class="annot">The use of packaging as a marketing tool is the subject of this thorough survey of historic developments, management, design, research, and reproduction. In a live-page section on color, Raphael suggests that the simplest colors are the most easily remembered and that color preferences are in a constant state of change. He describes a few examples of color associations and notes that associations vary from country to country. In addition to the symbolic and psychological aspects of color, Raphael covers the concepts of legibility and visibility, two important elements in achieving the attention-attracting purpose of packaging. His 12 rules for selecting color include attention to appeal, retention, simplicity, appearance, materials and lighting. The general color information, recommendations, and documentation remains valuable, however the lack of illustrations is a big shortcoming. </p></div>
