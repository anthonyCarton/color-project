<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">310. Brooklyn Botanic Garden. Dye Plants and Dyeing: A Handbook. Brooklyn, 1964. 100 pp. B/W illus., color illus. </p><p class="annot">This handbook contains articles originally published in Plants & Gardens, volume 20, number 3. The articles cover topics that range from personal experiences to historical information for dye recipes. As a group, the articles provide essential information on natural plant dyes and how to use them. The recipes for dyes using various plants describe the hues, values, and chromas that can be expected and offer hints on how various fibers will take the dyes. An excellent color chart shows the results of using the dye recipes on wool fabrics. Essays by experts, for the most part devoted to dyeing techniques of other cultures, include special tips on manipulating color. Although this book will be most relevant to those studying the historic or cultural backgrounds of natural dyeing, it is also useful for those wanting to dye their own cloth or yarn using natural materials. The final essay lists and annotates 13 key historical works on dyeing. </p></div>
