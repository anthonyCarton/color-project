New York: McGraw-Hill, 1963. 240 pp. B/W illus., color illus. </p><p class="annot">The introductory portion of this book provides brief information onadditive and subtractive color and their related color circles, the Ostwald color system, objective and subjective perception of color, color symbolism, pigments, and painting supplies. Practical application of this information is first observed in the works of great masters and then related to oil, tempera and watercolor painting, colored pencils, pastels, lithography, stained glass, decorative painting and printing. A final short chapter looks at color use from pre-historic times to the 20th century. This overview of the use of color in the fine and applied arts has broad appeal, but readers new to the Ostwald color system will need to supplement the brief information provided here. </p></div>
