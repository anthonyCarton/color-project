<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib special">170. Albers, Joseph. Interaction of Color. 2nd printing. New Haven:Yale University Press, 1971. 81 pp. B/W illus., color illus. ISBN 0-300- 0 1 846-0. </p><p class="annot">This student edition consists solely of the text volume which isunabridged although reduced to 6 by 8 inches, and a small sampling of the many color plates in the original 1963 edition. Missing are the commentary volume and the many beautiful silk-screened color plates. The text presents 25 color relativity studies from Albers’s color course at Yale that are based on color paper experiments with such color illusions as transparency, middle mixture, vibrating and vanishing boundaries, fluting, afterimage, and the Weber-Fechner law and the Bezold effect. Some readers find the text somewhat difficult to follow since Albers rarely states a clear definition and leaves the reader to draw conclusions from musical analogies and the experiments. Absence of an index remains a drawback. Nonetheless, this edition has conveyed Albers’s innovative presentation of color relativity to several generations of students. </p></div>
