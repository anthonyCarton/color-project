Boston, 1989. 223 pp. B/W illus., color illus. </p><p class="annot">This SIGGRAPH (Special Interest Group for Graphics) tutorial text compiles contributions from computer scientists Gary Meyer (chair) and William Cowan; Maureen Stone, a staff researcher at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center; and Brian Wandell, a professor of psychology. The text covers color perception and color measurement, additive and subtractive color reproduction techniques, color television, color hardcopy, color synthesis, color selection, and ways of generating color in computer graphics. In the color printing section, Stone explains and illustrates the troublesome differences in the color gamuts of monitors and printers, which cause color fidelity difficulties for graphic designers when a monitor image is printed out as hard copy. The dedicated reader with knowledge of this highly technical field will find the articles and the comprehensive lists of references that appear throughout useful. </p></div>
