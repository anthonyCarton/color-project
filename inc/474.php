Zurich: ABC Edition, 1969. 200 pp. Index, bibl., B/W illus., color illus. </p><p class="annot">This discussion of graphic design and the function of packaging emphasizes the importance of color, from the visibility of the package at the point of sale to the memory value of the package after the sale. Favre summarizes basic color theory and applies it consistently. Several chapters address the psychological and physiological aspects of color with reference to packaging. Relevant examples of packaging from various European countries accompany the text. Some information is provided on procedures for package creation and a research method for determining the best design is described for several projects. One of only a few graphic design books devoted to color, this text has two outstanding feature: the abundant and excellent color illustrations and a list of 30 questions about the product, consumer, and sales that need to be addressed during the package design process. The bibliography is very brief. </p></div>
