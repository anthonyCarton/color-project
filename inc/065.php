New York: Wiley, 1963. 249 pp. Index, bibl., B/W illus., color illus. </p><p class="annot">In 1954, the Board of the Inter-Society Color Council appointed asubcommittee to create “a statement of the basic principles which should be included in any elementary teaching of color.” The resulting detailed outline of facts is intended to meet the needs of teachers and to serve as a reference for the knowledgeable student and for textbook writers. Color is defined as “an aspect of visual experience” with the characteristics of hue, saturation, and brightness. A discussion of how color is experienced is followed by a look at color science, color measurement, and color systems. The book concludes with information on color vision theory, color aptitude,and includes summary data of studies of color preference. Despite its age, this book is useful for its refreshingly direct outline format and for the clearly written text. </p></div>
