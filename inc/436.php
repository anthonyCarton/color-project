Woodbury, NY: Barron, 1982. 170 pp. Index, color illus. ISBN 0-8120-2172-X. </p><p class="annot">This translation of a 1978 German edition is presented by the author as an affordable and practical reference tool for specifying color for the printing industry. It consists mainly of charts that feature 46 screen tint combination grids that show 5,500 colors, with and without black, organized into a handy atlas with CYMK percentages that can be matched by printers. Explanations of the rationale for developing this model of color organization and brief descriptions of the relative color mixing technologies of color photography, color commercial printing, and color television are included. The reader seeking more theoretical discussions of color may use Kuepperâ€™s Basic Law of Color Theory as a supplement.</p></div>
