ISBN 471- 06337- 1. </p><p class="annot">This introductory design text begins with an overview of thepurposes of design. The chapter on organization takes a Gestalt-like approach, without identifying it as such. Each design element is the focus of a well-illustrated chapter, with examples drawn from the fine arts as well as clothing, jewelry, and the built and natural environment, that concludes with suggested exercises. The Prang Color System is explained thoroughly, but the Munsell color system is merely mentioned. The authors fail to attribute some theories, such as Schopenhauer’s Law of Areas, to the proper source. Lockhart and Beitler’s 10 suggestions for pleasing color harmonies go beyond the standard color schemes and may be of interest to students and practitioners. This is a simple but useful text despite its age. </p></div>
