<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">86. The British Colour Council Dictionary of Colours for Interior Decoration. 3 vols. London: British Colour Council, 1949. Color illus. </p><p class="annot">This pioneering effort to create color standards for business andindustry during the depression of the 1930s was interrupted by World War II and not completed until 1949. In the foreword John Glass acknowledges it as the work of BCC art director Robert Francis Wilson. This unique work shows 378 colors arranged in spectral order in three ways: as matte paint chips, as glossy paint chips, and as pile fabric. 131 colors chosen as suitable for interior design industries were selected from the 220 colors of the 1934 BCC color standard for textiles and apparel. Colors representing great historical periods were added in consultation with experts at the British Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum, Wallace Collection, and Temple Newsom. The text presents a fascinating, though undocumented, compilation of color history and color lore. The third volume’s 34 pages discuss color names, color matching, and juxtaposition of colors, which is Wilson’s term for simultaneous contrast. </p></div>
