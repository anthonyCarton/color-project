ISBN4- 7661-0351- 3. </p><p class="annot">This outstanding color reference predates another much smallerfashion design guide by Allen (1987) that also features superb Japanese color printing. The introduction features a 16-hue circle, a diagram of ten color families, and brief discussions of warm and cold, opposing, and juxtaposed colors. Most of the pages of this 9” by 12” book feature spirited full-page fashion drawings of three figures in western dress that are labeled throughout as sexy-modem, sporty, or feminine. Below each figure which is drawn in pencil and splashed with bold watercolor or pastel strokes, is a visual footnote in the form of small color proportion swatches with CMYK percentages needed to match the colors. Interesting captions describe the impact of the colors or suggest cultural or other color associations. The result is an exciting visual guide to apparel color. </p></div>
