<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">346. Hardy, Alexander C., ed. Colour in Architecture. London: Leonard Hill, 1967. 41 pp. color illus. </p><p class="annot">This collection of essays by 14 authors offers an absorbing cross-section of writings and research on color in architecture during the early 1960s. In his introduction, Hardy deplores the lack of information and research on color, which he says may be explained by its comparative complexity in relation to other factors contributing to design. Topics range from uses and sources of architectural color in the past to color design for safety. One essay by Derek Pool includes a literature review and summary of relevant concepts, while another by Eric De Mare describes a color plan for a community designed by an artist who adapts traditional British paint colors for the region. The broad range of subjects, the many color illustrations credited to consulting picture editor Eric De Mare, and the inclusion of documentation enhance this work. </p></div>
