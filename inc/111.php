<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">111. Wittgenstein, Ludwig. Remarks on Colour. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1977. 126 pp. ISBN 0-520-03335-3. </p><p class="annot">Wittgenstein writes informally about his color philosophy andcompares it with the philosophies of others. He explores color vocabulary and meaning in a text presented in German and English on alternating pages. While some may find this a charming and thought-provoking little book, others will be disturbed by the organization and format which consists of 350 numbered paragraphs without headings, illustrations, documentation, bibliography or index. </p></div>
