Most pages have diagrams and line drawings as well as text with specific guidelines. A special feature is the bibliography of 180 titles for four categories: basic human engineering references (including health and safety); architecture; highway engineering, and other human factors. An additional listing of information sources and organizations supplements the limited documentation within the text. Designers will find much of interest in the sections on color usage for consumer products; lighting design and appearance ratings of typical surface colors; visual displays and use of colors and equipment color-coding; visual response and visual system characteristics, typical colors and their effect on human color perception and glare, and recommended lamp colors for various task and locations. Information on the Munsell system is included. This handy reference condenses a huge body of essential information for industrial designers, architects, interior designers, furniture designers, planners, and engineers who must or should address human factors in the design process. </p></div>
