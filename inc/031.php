Berkeley: University of California Press, 1969. 178 pp. Index, bibl., endnotes/footnotes, B/W illus. ISBN 520-01442-1. </p><p class="annot">The authors present an analysis and comparison of terms for color in 20 languages, and report that semantic universals in color vocabulary relate to the historical development of all those languages. A total of 11 basic color categories are universal: white, black, red, green, yellow, blue, brown, purple, pink, orange, and gray. When a language has fewer than eleven basic categories, the terms in use follow strict limitations. Detailed information is provided on how different cultures describe or perceive color. Anyone interested in a cross-cultural look at the language of color will find this a useful starting point.</p></div>
