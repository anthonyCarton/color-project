New York: Wiley, 1967. 628 pp. Index, bibl., B/W illus. </p><p class="annot">Considered to be one of the most complete and important books onthe subject, this book is especially valued for its thorough treatment of colorimetry. Light sources, vision, color systems and scales, and measurement are also addressed in considerable detail. The 18-page bibliography primarily cites journal articles. Heavy reliance on complex mathematical equations and tables means this book will be difficult to understand without considerable prior knowledge. </p></div>
