Indianapolis: Bobbs- Merrill, 1980. 509 pp. index, B/W illus, color illus, ISBN 0-672-97164-X. </p><p class="annot">This text covers all aspects of graphic arts production. Lithographic printing is examined in 12 sections, each with numerous neat instructional units that conclude with a list of new terms, activities and assignments for students, and references for further reading. Three units in the design section introduce form and space, design principles, and color for designing. Light and color quality, proximity of colors, colored printing inks, and subtractive color principles are described and illustrated. The eight units in the color section cover color theory and practice, process color, mechanical color, color separations, color proofing, and the influence of paper on color printing. The clear writing and excellent organization make this information-packed book a good introduction to the field for graphic designers or for instructors seeking other viewpoints. The discussions of color are well supported by excellent full-page color plates and diagrams.</p></div>
