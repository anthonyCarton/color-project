<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib special">4. Buckley, Mary and David Baum. <em>Color Theory. </em>Detroit: Gale, 1975. Art and Architecture Information Guide 2. 173 pp. Index.</p><p class="annot">This is the definitive bibliography of color in fine arts. The books cited date from about 1900 to the early 1970s, with the majority of entries from 1920 to 1950. It is divided into 22 brief chapters, beginning with color adaptations and concluding with color vocabulary, with titles arranged alphabetically by author. The emphasis is on color theories and artists’ concepts of color rather than on application of the theories and concepts or how-to information for designers. Chapters vary considerably in length; many are only a page or two long. For example, the chapter on color design contains only a few “see” references to other chapters. Each complete citation is followed by a short, descriptive nonevaluative annotation. Although the coverage is not comprehensive, this book is valuable for its broad scope.</p></div>
