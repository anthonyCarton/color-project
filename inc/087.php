<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">87. The British Colour Council Dictionary of Colour Standards. 2nd rev. ed. London: British Colour Council, 1951. 58 pp. Color illus. </p><p class="annot">First issued in 1934, this color dictionary combines a color nametext and a companion atlas of mounted samples. Intended to standardize colors and color names for industrial use, it is coordinated to the BCC Dictionary of Colours for Interior Design (1949). This 1951 edition has 20 additional colors that meet practical criteria of color fastness and end use. The text volume lists color names and gives some historic uses and background. The atlas consists of 12 accordian-folded leaves. Mounted on each leaf are 20 woven, heavy silk ribbons with both shiny and ribbed bands that show how surface texture affects the appearance of the 240 individual colors. This dictionary provides an interesting document of mid- 20th-century color usage in business and industry. Curiously, dye formulas for replicating the colors are lacking. </p></div>
