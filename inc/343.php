A special feature is the thoroughly documented overview of color theory that explains and illustrates over a dozen systems developed between 1613 and 1980. An illustrated discussion of color topography helps the reader understand the ways in which color can be seen and used on exteriors. A case study and examples of color in cities throughout the world effectively reinforce the discussion. </p></div>
