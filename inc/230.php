ISBN 0-442-20825-1. </p><p class="annot">The authorâ€™s visual perception emphasis results in excellent chapterson vision, the brain, Gestalt principles, space, depth, motion and color. The brief but clearly written 14-page chapter on color begins with a discussion of color perception, the traditional 12-hue color wheel, and the hue, value, and intensity characteristics of color. Conventional color schemes are briefly explained, as are successive and simultaneous contrast, fluting, vibrating boundaries, transparency, and optical color mixture. Information on the psychological dimensions and associations of color and on color usage in art concludes the chapter. Many illustrations derived mainly from fine arts, exercises for students, chapter notes, and a 76-item briefly annotated bibliography complete this fine effort to integrate art and psychology. </p></div>
