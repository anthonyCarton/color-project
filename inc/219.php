Zurich:Musterschmidt, 1957. 38 pp. Color illus. </p><p class="annot">This elegant work by a leading British color authority and industrialdesigner consists of a brief text that explains the line plates with painted color chips that demonstrate how his “Color System” offers a practical way for artists and designers to mix colors. The 12 hues of his color circle seem to match Winsor & Newton designers colors. Based on red-blue-yellow or “painter’s primaries,” the 12 hues are painted out as scales mixed with black and with brown. He explains that the second set of hue scales mixed with brown creates the warmer tones needed by designers who match colors found in nature, such as flowers, as he did when he designed the original Royal Horticultural Colour Chart . Other special plates show chroma bridge color mixtures across the hue circle and demonstrate the “afterimage in relation to the spectrum,” presumably based on his own vision. His use of color terminology is unconventional. For example, he prefers “juxtaposition of colour” law to simultaneous contrast. Only 300 copies of this rare but undocumented book were produced. </p></div>
