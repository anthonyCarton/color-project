<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib special">78. Overheim, R. Daniel, and David L. Wagner. Light and Color. New York: Wiley, 1982. 269 pp. Index, bibl., color illus. </p><p class="annot">This highly readable college textbook contains sections on thephysical nature of light, the origin and analysis of color, color vision, the appearance of objects, optics, light and light sources, and color in nature. It also surveys early theories of color vision and explains simultaneous contrast and color constancy. The handsome color plates of special interest to designers show the spectrum, additive and subtractive primaries, Seurat paintings, process printing, and Land’s Retinex system. This book is somewhat similar to Light and Color Nature and Art by Samuel Williams and Herman Cummins, who commend Overheim in the foreword for writing a “concise, easy-to-teach” textbook. </p></div>
