<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">12. Parks, Berkeley. <em>Psychological Response to Surface Color.</em> Monticello, IL: Council of Planning Librarians, 1975. Exchange Bibliography # 902. 17 pp.</p><p class="annot">The first section consists of 222 citations, primarily in journals, to studies dealing with color response. The section’s five subdivisions are development of color sense, order of preference, past experience and color modification, color connotation and association, and color and judgment. The second section includes both books and journal articles that provide general information on color perception. Entries date from the late 1890s to the 1970s and are not annotated. The compilation of difficult-to-locate citations in a single source makes this a useful bibliography, though the publication lacks a note explaining criteria for selection.</p></div>
