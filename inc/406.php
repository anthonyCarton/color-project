New York: VanNostrand-Reinhold, 1972. 119 pp. B/W illus, color illus. </p><p class="annot">Although historic background information on color and light, and onadditive and subtractive color mixing is given, the authorâ€™s main purpose is to present four color instruments that he devised and built to assist in the study of color. He sees application of his instruments to display, merchandising, photography, interior design, psychotherapy, and the fine arts, and includes discussions of lumia, mobile color, light, and projections. This work is interesting from a historic viewpoint; however, the instruments and approach have not achieved common usage. </p></div>
