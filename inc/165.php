New York: Moffat, Yard, 1918. 343 pp. B/W illus. </p><p class="annot">The author begins with a general overview of color theory andprovides guidelines for choosing color combinations. A chapter on color design is followed by specific chapters on color in dress, home, and business. Weinberg then discusses the science of color and takes a more detailed look at color systems, with emphasis on Munsell and the hue, value, and chroma dimensions of color. An explanation of complementary colors and simultaneous contrast serves as a context for a discussion of color harmonies. Associations of color with music and moods, information on colored illumination and the use of color in theater conclude the volume. This book is most useful today as an example of principles for effective color use from the early 1900s. It is a forerunner of Art in Everyday Life by Harriet and Vetta Goldstein. </p></div>
