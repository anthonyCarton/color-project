ISBN 0-l3-942228-5- </p><p class="annot">The author nicely balances conceptual and practical material in thisinnovative basic design text,which devotes a quarter of its excellent content to color in design. An unusual feature is the author’s 14-hue circle based on the psychophysiological phenomenon of the negative afterimage. Here a hue’s complement is its afterimage. The gradated hue circle, arranged according to the “natural order of color” that he credits to H. Barrett Carpenter, locates yellows at the top, reds on the right side, and blues on the left, which converge on violet, the darkest value, at the bottom. In his survey of color systems and theories, which includes Chevreul, Munsell, and Rood, Harlan notes that because color systems are designed to serve several functions, they are both too complex and too simple for use by artists. He also discusses color perception and interaction, cites Itten’s seven contrasts and provides exercises for students for each major topic. The very thorough chapter on “elements of color” is well presented and includes helpful documentation and marginal notes. </p></div>
