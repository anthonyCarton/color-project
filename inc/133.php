ISBN 0-88740-096-5. </p><p class="annot">First published in 1961, this book provides basic information oncolor theory and color systems. The first section introduces color circles, color scales, uniform chroma scales, color organization, color mixture, color harmony, and value, and then applies color theory to the palettes of master painters and Birren himself. The second half deals with perception and uses illustrations and many Birren paintings to demonstrate luster, iridescence, luminosity, mists, and transparency. Each chapter ends with an exercise that introduces the student to hue, value, chroma, and the hue circle. Topics are covered briefly but well. However, inferior illustrations detract from this otherwise useful introduction to color. </p></div>
