<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">121. Rood, Roland. Color and Light in Painting. New York: Columbia University Press, 1941. 299 pp. Index, B/W illus.</p><p class="annot">The author, son of the physicist Ogden Rood known for his Modern Chromatics (1879), combines his knowledge as a painter with a knowledge of color science in this work, which was incomplete at the time of his death in 1927. He worked on this book for 15 years, incorporating information on the history of painting practice, aesthetic theory, and color science and perception. The writing is sometimes awkward and obscure, and there have been many advances in the study of color since this book was written, however it may interest those seeking a historical perspective. </p></div>
