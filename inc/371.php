</p><p class="annot">This revision of a standard work in the field of interior design encompasses the broad range of issues related to planning and furnishing a home. The major design and color section deals with color and light, color theory and characteristics, and the Munsell and Ostwald color systems. The discussion of standard color harmonies is clearly illustrated with small black-and-white diagrams of hue circles and references to color plates. A series of substantive questions and answers help readers explore the relationship between theory and practice in interior design. The combination of a straightforward writing style, appropriate illustrations, and a bibliography at the end of each chapter yields an excellent resource. </p></div>
