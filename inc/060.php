<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib special">60. Zakia, Richard D., and Hollis N. Todd. Color Primer I & II. Dobbs Ferry, NY: Morgan & Morgan, 1974. 75 pp. Index, color illus. ISBN O-87100-021-0. </p><p class="annot">This programmed manual guides the reader through 66 questions onbasic color concepts to be answered in writing in the spaces provided. Color Primer I covers light primaries; Color Primer II covers the subtractive primaries of dyes, paints, and filters. Short summary sections conclude each primer, and a set of colored filters is provided for use in demonstrating the effects of light primary mixing. Bold colored diagrams illustrate many topics ranging from a comparison of the subtractive primaries with the colors of light to choosing colored lens filters to achieve a desired effect in photography. A useful distinction is made between lightness as reflected light, and brightness as direct light. Using a format associated with the work of B. F. Skinner, the reader first works through Color Primer I which is laid out on the top half' of each page, then turns the book upside down to read Color Primer II. The explanations and diagrams are excellent; however, some readers may be distracted by seeing the brightly colored visuals for both primers at the same time. </p></div>
