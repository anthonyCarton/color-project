<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">134. Birren, Faber. Principles of Color. New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1969. 96 pp. Bibl., B/W illus., color illus. </p><p class="annot">This elementary color handbook briefly discusses color circles,theories of color harmony, and color effects, that is, color and value combinations that produce Birrenâ€™s favorite illusions: luster, iridescence, luminosity, and transparency. Principles of Color appears to be a simplified and briefer version of his Creative Color. The poor color plates do not effectively illustrate his points. Nevertheless, readers new to the subject may find this an adequate introduction. </p></div>
