Most of the book presents dye recipes arranged alphabetically from alder leaves to zinnia petals. A key to the colors derived from dye plants is an especially useful feature. The information is presented clearly and concisely, making this a handy resource for the experienced dyer. However, the beginner may not find sufficient detail to initiate a dyeing project. No publisher is given. </p></div>
