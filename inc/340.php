ISBN 0- 9621871-0-0. </p><p class="annot">This is a technical manual, published by a quilter, with formulas forusing Procion MX fiber dyes. The two-page introduction to conventional color theory concludes with the primary dyes used by the author, which are based on the red-blue-yellow of the painter's primaries. Later she also recommends using “fuchsia, yellow and turquoise” of printer’s primaries. Eight charts summarize dyebath ingredients for quilt-cotton, and eight projects for dying color wheels and gradations are described. The practical suggestions and hints that fill the rest of the book will be useful to the novice dyer learning how to dye cotton fabrics in the studio, although the only illustrations are rough ink sketches. For comparison the reader may wish to see Color Formulas for Use with Procion M-Series Dyes (1986) by Jan Myers, whose workshop the author attended. </p></div>
