<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib special">28. Wagner, Carlton. Color Power + The Wagner Color Response Dictionary. Santa Barbara, CA: Wagner Institute for Color Research, 1985. 214 pp. B/W illus., color illus.</p><p class="annot">Insisting that it is human response to color that sells a product or ad, Wagner provides information on typical responses so the designer or marketing expert can use them to advantage. He contends that color preference and response are related to an individual’s position on the socioeconomic ladder. Although he states that “The impact of color is profound and largely unconscious, according to psychological and neurological research,” he does not reveal his sources. Some readers will be put off by his use of fictional case studies featuring Stella Biltrite, Rodney Ravish, Stanley Stunning and others. A set of 100 color swatches, identical to those found with the Wagner Color Response Report, is included.</p></div>
