ISBN 0-87773-076-8.</p><p class="annot">This collection of illustrations and essays about the myth, lore, physics, and metaphysics of rainbows, was created in conjunction with “The Rainbow Show,” a 1975 Bay Area celebration of color and light. Various chapters are printed on colored papers arranged in spectral order. Packed with unusual information as well as much that is generally known, this work is especially useful for its collection of material on color as it relates to music, symbolism, and auras. In each chapter, information is provided in increasing complexity. The essays, some carefully documented, are short and self-contained. The principal contributors are experts in their fields.</p></div>
