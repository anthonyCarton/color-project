Rumson, NJ: Primatic Art, 1948. 219 pp. Glossary, B/W illus., color illus. </p><p class="annot">This course of study details 38 exercises divided into three parts thatcould be used for three years to teach color theory as demonstrated in Jacob’s The Art of Colour also published in 1948. The author’s theory of color is based on then-current discoveries in the scientific and artistic worlds. The complementary pairs on his 24-hue circle sometimes agree with Munsell and anticipate Itten and sometimes do not. Most of the book is a guide to using colored pencils to fill in designs with prescribed color schemes that progress from one color and one complement, to six colors with five complements. As in Jacobs’s hue circle configuration, if all colors in each scheme were mixed a perfect neutral gray would result. One triad and one monochromatic lesson and a chapter on still-life painting conclude the book. The book may be useful as a record of an early approach to teaching color. </p></div>
