The author advocates the “use of color, pattern and texture to complement, enhance, or accentuate ceramic form.” Photographs of internationally known potters and their creative work documents the discussion of the contemporary ceramics movement. Here the emphasis is on design process and technique, while his Studio Ceramics, (1983) covers color more fully. </p></div>
