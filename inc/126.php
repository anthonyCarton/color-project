<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">126. Wehlte, Kurt. The Materials & Techniques of Painting. Translated by Ursus Dix. New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1982. 672 pp. Index, B/W illus. ISBN 0-442-29162-0. </p><p class="annot">Comprehensive coverage of the materials and techniques used for both historic and modern wall and easel painting makes this an authoritative resource for anyone who paints or studies painting. Especially useful to the color researcher is a 100-page section that lists pigments and identifies their chemical composition, history, permanence, toxicity, and other important characteristics. A concise discussion of color, located in an appendix, includes an explanation of additive and subtractive color, color theory, and color harmonies, with an emphasis on the needs of the artist. The excellent color plates that illustrate the 1975 German edition, were omitted from this paperback English edition, limiting its usefulness. The reader is advised to consult the German edition to see to the excellent color plates to supplement use of the English edition of this unusually comprehensive book. </p></div>
