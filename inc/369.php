ISBN 0-904928-04-7. </p><p class="annot">Blake provides a general overview aimed at readers of English womenâ€™s magazines such as Good Housekeeping, Homemaker and Homes and Gardens. Ten chapters and numerous illustrations cover such topics as the color wheel, color basics, choosing colors, planning interiors, lighting, period flavor, and exterior color plans. This is an interesting example of popular consumer-oriented interior design journalism of the 1970s and early 1980s that shows practical application. </p></div>
