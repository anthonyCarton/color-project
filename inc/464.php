<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib special">464. Denton, Craig. Graphics for Visual Communication. Dubuque, IA: Wm. C. Brown, 1992. Index, bibl., glossary, B/W illus., color illus. ISBN 0-697-08540-6. </p><p class="annot">This excellent and comprehensive text covers both “editorial communication” for newspaper and magazine production and “persuasive communication” for advertising and public relations. Introductory chapters place graphics within historical, environmental, and psychological contexts, the latter with reference to Gestalt perception principles. Next, consideration is given to design, typographic, color, and photographic principles. The rest is packed with background and practical information on application and desktop and traditional production methods and technology. A color chapter with many color plates briefly surveys the physical, physiological, environmental, cultural, technological, symbolic, and aesthetic contexts for color and summarizes color connotations. Other color topics include hue, value, and saturation, and conventional 12-hue circles demonstrate complementary, split complementary, triad, and tetrad relationships. A color contrast section reminiscent of Itten touches on afterimage, simultaneous contrast, light/dark contrast, warm/cold contrast, and color proportion. A discussion of color reproduction summarizes additive and subtractive color mixing. Intended as a general reference, the book contains helpful marginal notes, concluding summaries and lists of six or more points to remember for each chapter. </p></div>
