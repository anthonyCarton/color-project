ISBN 0-88229-107-6.</p><p class="annot">This documented scholarly study begins with a brief review of classic treatises by Goethe, Chevreul, Bezold, Munsell, and Ostwald. Brief summaries are presented of research on color symbolism, the color preferences of children, and color preferences related to religion, race, and climate. The final three chapters cover the perception of color and how the brain interprets the physical stimulus of color; Gestalt psychology concepts of figure-ground organization, similarity groupings, and closure; and application of color psychology to interiors, advertising, and marketing. The subject and name indices and the endnotes provide useful references for further investigation. A shortcoming is the lack of visual documentation such as color plates.</p></div>
