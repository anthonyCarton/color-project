<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">100. Ostwald, Wilhelm. The Color Primer. Edited by Faber Birren. New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1969. 96 pp. Bibl., B/W illus., color illus. </p><p class="annot">Birren provides the editing, a brief foreword, and evaluation for this“liberally translated and edited reprinting” of Ostwald’s Color Primer. The Color Primer is a more elementary explanation of the color system than Ostwald’s Colour Science (1931). The discussion of achromatic colors and the creation of a gray scale based on geometric progressions is very detailed and well illustrated. A section on how the admixture of white or black affects the perceived appearance of a hue contains useful information not often found in the literature. Because discussion of Ostwald’s color system, color solid, and color harmonies is very brief, this book is suitable mainly as an introduction. For a more comprehensive view, see Basic Color by Egbert Jacobson (1948). </p></div>
