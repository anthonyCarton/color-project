B/W illus., color illus.</p><p class="annot">A very brief explanation of the Munsell color notation system isfollowed by 40 pages with glossy-finish color standards that represent more than 1,500 Munsell notations. Organized into two loose-leaf notebooks, the ten Munsell hues are shown at their 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10 degree positions. Each page contains slits into which the 5/8” by 3/4” chips are inserted according to Munsell hue, value, and chroma. Color specification in science and industry relies heavily on this system, and the Munsell approach to organizing perception-based color spaces has increasing relevance for computer graphics. The system is explained in detail in Munsell ’s Color Notation (1971). </p></div>
