Spring Valley, NY: Anthroposophic Press, 1986. 159 pp. Bibl., endnotes/footnotes, color illus. ISBN 0-880- 10088-5. </p><p class="annot">Originally published in German in 1951, this is an effort to vindicateGoethe’s scientific work on color and to recognize his achievements. The step-by-step examination of the “Didactic Part” of Goethe’s Color Theory attempts to demonstrate the errors in many then-accepted color dogmas while providing a more correct understanding of Goethe’s phenomenological approach to color. To fully experience and understand Goethe’s approach to color, the author provides a prism and 16 black-and-white and color plates with instructions for their use. This philosophic and poetic approach to color, combined with firsthand observation may appeal to those who study Goethe’s color experiments. </p></div>
