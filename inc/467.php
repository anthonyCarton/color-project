<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">467. Hamilton, Edward A. Graphic Design for the ComputerAge. New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1970. 191 pp. Index, bibl., glossary, B/W illus., color illus. </p><p class="annot">Based on the author’s experience in directing design for print media, this general survey of visual communication is not about computers, nor does it contain much information on design and color. A five~page chapter on color states that while color is useful for representing realism and for providing visual codes that help the viewer sort and clarify information, it is not essential for all visual information problem solving. He argues that color is too often misused in information design when its sole purpose is to attract attention. Despite the many illustrations and examples, glossary, and the bibliography, the book’s value may be limited to documenting graphic design in the 1960s. </p></div>
