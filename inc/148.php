<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">148. Harris, Moses. The Natural System of Colors. New York: Whitney Library of Design, 1963. 21 pp. B/W illus., color illus. </p><p class="annot">Harris first published his theories in 1766, and, according to FaberBirren, who provides historical notes and commentary, this was the first known publication of the color circle in full color. It was also one of the earliest attempts to organize colors into a comprehensive system that included both “prismatic” or primary and “compound” or secondary colors. Birren’s comments, including his discussion of Harris’s “natural” succession of hues and why it is appropriate for them to be placed in circular form, are helpful additions to this historical document. </p></div>
