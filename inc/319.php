A chart shows groups of plants that make yellow, green, brown, purple, black, red, orange, pink, and grey/blue/violet, with the most practical easiest to find plants listed in italics. While the pen and ink drawings for each of the plants are beautiful, one regrets the total absence of color. </p></div>
