Berkeley: University of California Press, 1974. 508 pp. Index, bibl., endnotes/footnotes, B/W illus., color illus. ISBN 0-520-02327-7.</p><p class="annot">This book is as valuable for its nearly 500-item bibliography and endnote references as for its excellent 37-page chapter on color perception, which addresses concepts vital to understanding color, such as the components of perception, reactions to color, syntax of color, mutual completion and complements. Armheim operates from an essentially Gestalt viewpoint in this interesting bridge between art and psychology. Balance, shape, form, growth, space, movement, light, color, dynamics, and expression are analyzed with regard to the visual arts. While the book is geared to the advanced student who has had exposure to analysis of visual arts, prior knowledge is not assumed. </p></div>
