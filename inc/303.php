Seattle, WA: ColorTrends, 1990. 130 pp. B/W illus., color illus. </p><p class="annot">This imaginative publication consists of brief essays and handsomeillustrations, contributed by 13 craftspeople, grouped into six chapters titled “Colors and Dyes,” “Colour of Fiber,” “Woven Colorés,” “Surface Coleur,” “Quilted Kolor,” and “All the Trimmings.” Topics in the “Colors and Dyes” chapter include the history of purple (by Marj Hudson), how Mexican dyers create purple dyes from shellfish (by Michele Wipplinger), iridescence, and a presentation of the summer 1990 color trends in fabrics. Other chapters cover hand-spinning, ikat, marbling fabric (by Don Guyot), art hazards, and hot-line information on materials. The practical information, the many tipped-in fiber or fabric samples, the captivating photographs of weavers and dyers from several ethnic groups, and the stimulating ideas for the studio artist make this a visual feast for fiber artists and designers. </p></div>
