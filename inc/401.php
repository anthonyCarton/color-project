ISBN 0-00-412390-5. </p><p class="annot">Planning for the garden around color is the author‘s theme. Hisdiscussion of color is based on a traditional colored 12-hue wheel, which the author augments with bands of tints and shades. He suggests perennials and shrubs for three-season color and gives practical ideas for unifying the garden through color, for example, by judicious placement of warm and cool hues to create illusions of depth, closeness, and breadth. The method of grouping plants in a spectral color sequence, though strongly reminiscent of Jekyll, is not attributed to her. While color photographs of selected plants appear on every page of the informative text, readers seeking a completely illustrated A-to-Z plant guide may wish to use the author‘s Planter's Encyclopedia of Perennials, published in London by MacDonald Orbis in 1988, as a companion volume.</p></div>
