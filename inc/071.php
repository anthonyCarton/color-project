Main sections cover the eye and light, color measurement tools such as spectrophotometers and colorimeters, color standards, and the physics involved in colorant layers. The highly technological viewpoint that focuses on industrial use of color assumes a working knowledge of complex mathematics which limits its usefulness to a design audience. </p></div>
