Chicago: Wilcox & Follett, 1949. 123 pp. Index, bibl., B/W illus., color illus. </p><p class="annot">The author contends that there are no absolute rules for color harmony; designers must “feel” it. However, he also believes that relative color harmony can be accurately calculated up to a point. Using the 12-hue color wheel and a curious metal calibrator embedded in the cover of the book, he illustrates the standard color harmonies on the hue circle and with photographs of interiors. After brief explanations of color characteristics and color harmony, he relates color to interiors, artificial lighting, public space, advertising, package design, and clothing. The concluding chapter summarizes major color theorists and their systems from Isaac Newton to Michael Jacobs. Although dated, the presentation is still interesting for its combination of intuitive and calculated approaches. </p></div>
