This scholarly account of Kandinsky’s role at the Bauhaus presents a collection of student work from his “Color Seminar,” and describes and analyzes materials that includes Kandinsky’s statements and course notes taken by his students. Fully one half of the book is devoted to Kandinsky‘s study and teaching of color: color relativity, color polarities, spatial phenomena, correspondence of colors and forms, color psychology,.the hue circle, simultaneous contrast, and color in pictorial compositions. When addressing color issues the artist states that he relied on Goethe’s Theory of Color and his own On the Spiritual in Art. Originally published in Germany in 1982, this rich resource for color theorists and educators interested in the approach of a renowned artist- teacher is enhanced by beautiful color printing done in Japan. </p></div>
