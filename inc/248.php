This book documents the course sequence mainly through illustrations, which are accompanied by minimal text and very brief course descriptions. One color course consists of exercises that explore color as material through painting and collage techniques. A second course focuses on changing color relationships as colors vary in hue, value, intensity, and proportion. This book will be most useful to readers seeking an overview of the highly regarded curriculum, and to those looking for studio exercises that range from studies of letter forms to experimental work with fibers or clay. </p></div>
