Readers at all levels will find the writing interesting and accessible. An introduction to Ostwald’s 24 hue circle is followed by a detailed, step-by-step discussion of color harmony using the system. The essentials of color science, color vision, and the basics of color interaction are also addressed. A unique feature is a section which analyzes and diagrams the colors in 12 paintings using the Ostwald color system. This book’s usefulness is not lessened by its 1948 publication date; neither the information nor the style are dated. </p></div>
