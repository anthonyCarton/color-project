ISBN 0-89257-051-2. </p><p class="annot">This practical handbook was written to help home owners selecthistorically appropriate colors for American houses built from 1820 to 1920, and to use those colors to emphasize the character and detail of the structures. A well-documented essay provides information on historic use of color in decorative exterior detailing. One hundred color plates reproduced from original printed sources graphically illustrate color usage. A “color affinity chart” keyed to what the author calls “heritage colors,” Munsell notations for the 57 colors found in two of the earliest surviving color cards, and a bibliography make this a superb resource for home owners or design professionals interested in authentic historic restoration. </p></div>
