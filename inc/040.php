New York: Random House, 1969. 185 pp. Appendices, color illus.</p><p class="annot">This is a shortened version of a color test developed by the author, a Swiss psychologist, who claims it has found wide clinical acceptance as a diagnostic tool since it was introduced in 1948. Samples of the four psychological primaries -- blue, yellow, red and green -- and four auxiliary colors are used to determine personal color preferences through an individual’s choosing and sequencing of the eight colors. Interpretation tables are furnished. Since the colors are presented for choice without the need to consider a second color that will harmonize with it, the test is said to determine personal color preferences. An introductory chapter on the origin of color significance and central chapters on the meaning of the eight colors and the structural meaning of color pairs provide a general context. Discussions of non-European or multicultural populations and of gender differences are lacking. Lüscher’s work may be useful in comparison with the opinions expressed by Faber Birren, Eric Danger, and Carlton Wagner, and writers of popular books on color.</p></div>
