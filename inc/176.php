ISBN 0-442-24037-6. </p><p class="annot">This color classic, first published in German in 1961, and rapidlyadopted by American educators, explains color theory and color principles with examples from the history of art. One chapter is devoted to each of seven color contrasts: light-dark, hue, warm-cold, complementary, simultaneous, saturation, and of special importance to designers, the contrast of extension which determines areas of color according to their numerical light values -- here attributed to Goethe (rather than to Schopenhauer as held by Albers.) Large illustrations and tipped-in color plates in the 1973 edition contribute to the bookâ€™s beauty and usefulness. A new 1990 printing is essentially the same except that it is entirely printed by offset . A simplified and condensed version for student use is available under the title The Elements of Color. </p></div>
