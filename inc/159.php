<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">159. Renner, Paul. Color: Order and Harmony. Translated by AlexanderNesbitt. New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1964. 80 pp. B/W illus., color illus. </p><p class="annot">First published in Germany in 1947, this book attempts to addresscolor harmony issues of interest to artists, designers, and craftspeople. Unfortunately, the writing style of this translation is poor, the descriptions are wordy and unenlightening, and the overall tone is frequently negative or self-serving. Renner disparages Goethe and Ostwald, yet his own opinions do not always stand up to critical review. For example, he explains the lavender-colored afterimage of yellow is caused by the reddish color of daylight. The value of this work now is as a historic curiosity and statement of personal beliefs about color. </p></div>
