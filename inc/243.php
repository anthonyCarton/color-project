ISBN 0-697-01499-01. </p><p class="annot">This perception based design foundations text describes,demonstrates and illustrates integration strategies based on Gestalt grouping principles that are intended to lead to design unity. While the discussions and studio experiences for students focus on two- and three-dimensional design and drawing, connections are made to interior design, architecture, and graphic design. Many handsome examples of paintings, brayer prints, weaving, quilting, and computer-generated designs by artists and students enhance this book. Discussion of color appears in the final “Color as Design” chapter where color is treated as “one of the elements of design rather than as a separate thing in itself.” The brief information on color focuses on Munsell. </p></div>
