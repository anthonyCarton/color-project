London: Winsor & Newton, 1935. 52 pp. B/W illus. </p><p class="annot">This book is a simplified version of concepts originally explained inthe more complex Colour Science by Ostwald himself. Though not as comprehensive or well illustrated as Egbert Jacobsonâ€™s Basic Color: An Interpretation of the Ostwald Color System, this remains one of the few useful secondary sources on the Ostwald system. </p></div>
