Discussions of color basics such as color theory, color contrast, color harmony, and color and mood make up most of the text, although technical and practical information on many topics is also provided. The hue circle and primary and complementary colors of light are presented in diagrams. The striking photographs by leading professional photojournalists are analyzed in the well-written text that covers one third of each page. Shot around the globe, the photograph’s subjects range from portraits, people and events, to landscapes. A useful glossary is included. The high quality of the photographs, informative text, and handsome book design will please the general reader as well as the specialist. </p></div>
