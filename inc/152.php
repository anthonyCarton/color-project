<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">152. Jorgensen, Charles Julius. The Mastery of Color. 2 vols. Milwaukee: 1906. Vol. 1, 83 pp. Vol.2:, 22 pp. B/W illus., color illus. </p><p class="annot">The author rejects a scientific approach to color; though he mentionsseveral color theories, he does not credit their originators. In volume 1 he uses red, yellow, and blue as primaries to develop his own 18-hue color wheel. Volume 2 contains 22 beautiful color plates including the author’s hue circle and many exquisite chroma bridges. Although the value of this book now is primarily as a historic example and as a document of the author’s work to organize color, readers will still be impressed with the quality and beauty of the color plates that incorporate painted color chips. </p></div>
