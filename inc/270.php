ISBN 0-7064-2906-0. </p><p class="annot">A book production team and fashion consultant Caroline Bakercreated this lively spiral bound “file” of Benetton ideas on color and apparel. In the introduction Luciano Benetton states that “colour was my first business idea: designing clothes purely by colour was a totally original concept.” His passion for color is at the heart of this exuberant statement on life-style and fashion. Various sections present color theory and color preference; a self-test for four personality and mood types; and eleven different hues, values, or color groupings illustrated by Benetton garments. Other garments demonstrate camouflage, playing with pattern, and themes related to occasion or function. An afterimage exercise is suggested for the reader to follow. While books on color and fashion usually only give general guidelines, this one provides an exciting approach to color that can be followed up in Benetton shops. The unusual design of the file and vivid use of color will cheer anyone with an eye for color. </p></div>
