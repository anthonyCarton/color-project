ISBN 0-291-39715-8. </p><p class="annot">In this entirely unillustrated book Danger presents guidelines for the promotional use of print in graphic design, with four sections on general principles, print, practical details, and the selection process followed by an index of 13 colors and gray. He summarizes Gestalt grouping principles, psychological responses to color, and optical and physiological facts. In an interesting and thought-provoking index on color he systematically describes color connotations, functions, and applications. For example, he tells which colors should not be used for goods exported to specific countries. Stating that this thorough examination of color use in the graphic design business is based on a “lifetime of practice and collecting information,” he does not cite his sources. The bibliography consists primarily of titles from the 1950s and 1960s, including 1 1 titles by Faber Birren. While Danger’s focus on the English market may limit the book’s usefulness for the American reader, he maps out an increasingly important domain that lacks systematic research. </p></div>
