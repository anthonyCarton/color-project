<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib special">444. Kobayashi, Shigenobu. A Book of Colors. New York: Kodansha, 1987. 128 pp. Color illus. ISBN 0-87011-800-5. </p><p class="annot">The author is a researcher in psychology and founder of the Nippon Color and Design Research Institute in Japan, which developed the “Color Image Scale” that is the foundation of its psychology-of-color theories. Using this scale, the book presents color combinations, considered universal by the author, based on 18 moods such as “Urbane, Sweet, and Folksy.” The second part of the book shows 18 major colors in varying combinations and proportions. The 1,200 combinations are very small in size, but their large number makes this a useful resource. The useful although brief and undocumented commentary on every page refers mainly to color usage, meaning, and associations related to clothing and interiors. Information on the system and on color theory based on a 10-hue color circle is located in the middle of the book rather than at the beginning. </p></div>
