ISBN 0-85274-426-9. </p><p class="annot">The author, chair of the Colour Group of Great Britain, outlines thehistorical and chemical development of dyes and pigments from the stone age to modem computer matching. The book provides an excellent overview of the main theories and mechanisms of color vision, the variables of perceived-color vision related to color atlases, and the processes and instruments used to measure color, and firmly addresses the interests of fiber artists and technicians. McLarenâ€™s ability to enliven the history of color discoveries and inventions makes this a highly readable introduction to the field. The impressive bibliography which includes many international references, provides a valuable resource for further study. </p></div>
