<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib special">494. Mante, Harald. Color Design in Photography. New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1972. 108 pp. Index, color illus. ISBN 0-442-26308-2 . </p><p class="annot">Intended as a manual on color and design for photographers, this book is sufficiently general to be useful to a broader audience. Mante discusses basic color theory, color characteristics, and color harmony, and presents Itten’s seven color contrasts in photographs. Although he properly credits Itten, he incorrectly attributes Goethe’s nine-hue triangle to George Field. Beautiful color photographs clearly illustrate the text. This book is valuable not only for the information it contains, but also because it clearly demonstrates that color theory relates to nature and the environment and has practical applications.</p></div>
