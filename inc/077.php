New York: Crowell, 1953. 385 pp. Bibl., endnotes/footnotes, glossary, B/W illus., color illus. </p><p class="annot">The foundations of color science are clearly presented in thiscollaborative book. A historical overview of color use and the origins of color science is followed by a nontechnical discussion of color theory. The book then becomes considerably more technical in its discussion of the physiological and psychological aspects of color and methods for colorimetry and color standards. Although now dated, this well- documented resource offers an interesting perspective on color science and technology in the 1950s since it was prepared by leading scientists Ralph M. Evans of Eastman Kodak , Deane I. Judd of the U.S. National Bureau of Standards, and Matthew Luckiesh of General Electric. </p></div>
