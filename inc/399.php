Thomas’s aim is to shift attention away from concentrating solely on flowers that may bloom only for a few weeks to creating special color interest in the garden for most of the year in the mild climate of southeast England. He directs readers to select shrubs and trees while keeping in mind the colors of leaves, stems, and bark. The author’s spirited line drawings and watercolors accent this text. </p></div>
