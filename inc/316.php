The author’s discussion of color mixing is based on magenta, cyan, and yellow, which he calls “secondary” colors although he uses them to mix blue, red, and green which he nonetheless calls “primary” colors. The single illustration is a color plate that shows 85 naturally dyed colors very effectively. Arranged in alphabetical order from alkanet to woad, the entries for each color also provide the Methuen Handbook of Color notation match and light fastness and wash fastness ratings. Recipes for 22 natural dye stuffs are also given, including variants for compound colors and lighter and darker variants. This book will be most useful to the dye specialist. </p></div>
