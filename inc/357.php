New York: Whitney Library of Design, 1982. 128 pp. Index, bibl., color illus. ISBN 0-8230-7407-2. </p><p class="annot">This American edition of Color Outside affirms color as a vitalelement of architectural design. The author contends that a fusion of form and color can both coordinate with the environment and create a new environment. A brief historical overview looks at color in architecture from ancient Greece to contemporary buildings in Europe and North and South America. The many interesting topics range from color association and symbolic color to Jean Philippe Lenclosâ€™s method of using soil samples as a point of departure. A summary of color theory, with an emphasis on the Munsell color system, and a discussion of the implications of color relativity for architectural color strengthen the book. The highly readable text is accompanied by numerous color illustrations of buildings throughout the world. The 26 item international bibliography contains books and articles published between 1972 and 1980. The introduction is by Michael Graves. </p></div>
