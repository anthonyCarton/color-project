ISBN 0-395-18552-1. </p><p class="annot">This text looks at clothing in social, cultural, psychological,physical, economic, and aesthetic contexts. The author discusses color in dress in several chapters as an aspect of artistic perception and expression, as it relates to standards of beauty and taste, and as it influences appearance. She covers the three dimensions of color in the Munsell color system, afterimages, simultaneous contrast, and the standard color harmonies. Unlike many texts, this one provides the reader with footnotes and a short bibliography after each chapter. </p></div>
