Cincinnati: North Light, 1988. 144 pp. Index, B/W illus., color illus. ISBN 0-89134-254-0. </p><p class="annot">This spectacular production by the London Quarto group is a guideto understanding how pigment colors behave. Large color plates on every page and informative text demonstrate subtractive color mixing in oils, watercolor, acrylic, and pastel. The book shows how paints are made, suggests starter palettes in the four media, gives the mechanics of color mixing, includes step-by-step photographs of paintings and illustrations in process, and provides photographs and details of completed works and approximations of the personal palettes of many artists. A chapter treats problem subjects such as snow or reflective surfaces. Two chapters, which make up a quarter of the book, incorporate color theory by analyzing paintings for their use of complementary colors, warm and cool, color temperature, and color balance. One section is devoted to seeing and judging color relationships and color relativity, and to mixing and placing colors in a composition. Many pages show tinting mixtures. Other useful features include a paint identification chart that compares color ranges made by Winsor & Newton, Rowney, Grumbacher, Holbein, LeFranc& Bourgeois, and Schmincke. This reference will be particularly useful for its practical information on mixing color in the context of contemporary illustration and painting. </p></div>
