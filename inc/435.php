ISBN 0-442- 11386-2. </p><p class="annot">This is an elementary explanation of the Hickethier color classification system and practical method for mixing inks, dyes, and pigments, first introduced in 1940. Yellow, process red or magenta, and process blue or cyan are the primaries in his 18-hue color circle. Hue, saturation (or hue mixed with white), and darkness (or hue mixed with black) are the basis for the three dimensions of color in this system. By strategically placing the primary and secondary hues and black and white at the comers of the Hickthier color cube, the orderly gradation of intervening of hues and values results in 1,000 colors identified with a three-number code that specifies the location of a color within the cube, and also serves as the formula for mixing the color. The text briefly reviews the development of color classification systems and also discusses simultaneous contrast and complementary contrast. This spiral-bound book comes with sheets of pre- cut colored discs that must be detached and pasted to coded diagrams in the body of the text. Although this is the primary source, readers wanting more detailed information on the Hickethier system will want to consult DeGrandisâ€™s Theory and Use of Color. </p></div>
