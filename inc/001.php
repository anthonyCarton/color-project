Faber Birren Collection of Books on Color: A Bibliography. New Haven: Yale University Library, 1982. 42 pp. ISBN 0-89235-080-6.</p><p class="annot">In 1971, colorist Faber Birren presented his personal collection of rare and historic books on color to Yale University. These books span a broad range of color topics, with special emphasis on human response to color. This listing of 673 titles includes holdings on color theory, color systems and standards, color usage, perception, vision, psychology, printing, textiles, music, religion, nature, medicine, and the occult. Arrangement is alphabetical by author and each citation is keyed to one or more of 18 subject categories. Publication dates for these books range from the 1700s to the early 1970s. The inclusion of the Faber Birren books makes the Yale Library collection a major resource for color research by bringing together many rare or special works that are difficult to locate in the United States. This bibliography is particularly useful because it gives access to a collection now available on microfilm. Sixty-six of the titles are color specifier systems that are described in the appendix of <em>The Color Compendium </em>(1990) by Hope and Walch.  </p></div>
