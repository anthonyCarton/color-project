The 45-page chapter on color includes five lectures on color order, relationships, harmony, and movement, which incorporate ideas he attributes to Goethe, Runge, Delacroix and Kandinsky. Diagrams illustrating his basic color lessons reveal his own careful color strategies. Given Klee’s renown as an artist, this compilation of pedagogical writings is a valuable document of his visual thinking. </p></div>
