ISBN 0-671-60729-4. </p><p class="annot">After announcing that color theories are irrelevant to the artist, theauthor discusses art principles and color strategies by way of examining how color functions in specific paintings. He does not always use common color terminology. Those interested in paint will find a useful description of paints by name and a discussion of the advantages of each. The illustrations are plentiful, and exercises at the conclusion of each chapter, intended to help readers “get in touch” with the artists’ inherent skills, may guide those prepared to experiment with color and paint. </p></div>
