<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib special">461. Cook, Alton, and Robert Fleury. Type & Color: A Handbook of Creative Combinations. Rockport, MA: Rockport, 1989. 159 pp. Color illus. ISBN 0- 935606-19-0. </p><p class="annot">Brief essays by Allan Haley, Alan Peckolick, and George Cawthorn focus on color and letterforms. Writing on “Color Interactions and Contrast,” Cawthorn depicts temperature polarities in an interesting color wheel of his own design. Dramatic design projects by outstanding designers are accompanied by concise and often witty captions that analyze color relationships and impact. The designs, from mailing pieces to billboards, were created for such clients as Mobil, HBO Video, Vintage Books, Columbia Pictures, and Bank of America. The book also contains 100 pages of color samples. Each page shows six different color bands and gives their CMYK formulas. A pocket in the back cover holds 10 transparent overlays, each printed with eight typeface styles in three font sizes, in 18 color variations. The authors claim that the color pages and overlays allow for more than 800,000 combinations of color and type. In addition to previewing color combinations for type and background color, this cleverly designed book also facilitates study of color interaction through direct observation. </p></div>
