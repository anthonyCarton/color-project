<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">429. Luckiesh, Matthew. Light and Color in Advertising and Merchandising. New York: D. Van Nostrand, 1923. 268 pp. Index, B/W illus., color illus. </p><p class="annot">Luckiesh, a physicist at General Electric, relates color and light to their potential impact on advertising and merchandising. He describes the characteristics of color and how they can be utilized in an appealing and convincing way to reinforce the selling power of advertisement. He also deals with color preference, symbolism, and emotional response as they relate to “attention-value” (and therefore affect advertising) and makes some general recommendations for selecting colors. The last half of the book concentrates on lighting in relation to pigments in displays and interiors. Observation and research are said to be the basis for Luckiesh’s discussion, though no documentation is provided. This book will be of interest primarily to those who study the history of color usage in advertisement and merchandising. </p></div>
