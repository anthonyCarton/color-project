<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">242. Landa, Robin. An Introduction to Design: Basic Ideas and Applications for Paintings or the Printed Page. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall, 1983. 192 pp. Index, glossary, B/W illus., color illus. ISBN 0-13-480616-6. </p><p class="annot">Design and color are given equal coverage in this well-organized artfoundations course text. Each of the eleven chapters begins with a short discussion of a topic, followed with concise instructions for student projects, and concludes with helpful summaries of “knowledge gained.” The introductory chapter on color presents a “geometric color wheel” with 24 pigment colors, discusses hue, value, and chroma, and briefly runs through Albers’ explanation of simultaneous contrast. References to color in the context of basic design distinguish this design text. Color discussions and projects for students that explore color are well integrated into half of the book. Another special feature of this lively work is its orientation to application in both painting and the printed page, through inclusion of many exercises and examples from graphic design in addition to fine arts examples. Although it includes many black-and-white illustrations, this book deserves more than four pages of color plates. </p></div>
