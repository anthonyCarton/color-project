<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">37. Luckiesh, Matthew. Color and Colors. New York: D. Van Nostrand, 1938. 206 pp. Index.</p><p class="annot">The domain of this book is “the effectiveness of light and color” on human response. The author is especially concerned with “color play” or the mutual influence colors have on one another, better known now as simultaneous contrast. He also describes a condition he calls “mental color- blindness” as “a consciousness closed to the variety of interests obtainable from color.” Within this framework, Luckiesh gathers an unusual collection of ideas including color symbolism, color in the workplace, and poems with color images. This undocumented book is particularly interesting as an excursion into the domain of emotional responses to color, which may seem atypical for an author who is a physicist.</p></div>
