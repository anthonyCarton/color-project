<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib special">125. Walch, Margaret S. Color Source Book. New York: Scribner, 1979. 103 pp. B/W illus., color illus. ISBN 0-684-16134-6.</p><p class="annot">This is an excellent resource for anyone interested in a survey of historic color palettes. Developed for American Fabrics, the 46 palettes included are inspired by artifacts and works of art from various cultures and ethnic groups from ancient times to the 1970s, and represent fine arts, decorative arts, folk art, tapestries, masks, manuscripts, and pottery. The color chips are of very good quality, with a brief informational statement before each set. The author does not thoroughly explain her methodology or rationale for selecting the colors so it can’t be said with certainty whether the palettes are based on single examples or syntheses of many examples. Some of these palettes appear in the “Sources of Historic Colors” section of The Color Compendium by Augustine Hope and Margaret Walch published in 1990. </p></div>
