Boston: HoughtonMifflin, 1912. 214 pp. B/W illus. </p><p class="annot">The author’s overriding concern is with the “attainment of excellencein thinking and in technical performance.” Well known for his design and color theories, Ross prescribes 48 “set-palettes” for color harmony. He also advocates a “design” approach to drawing and painting and defines this as achieving order through use of repetition, sequencing, and balance. The remainder of this classic work deals with pure and applied design and modes of representation. The general discussion of color characteristics is relatively brief and the set-palette approach requires careful study. Ross’s writings on his systematic formal approach had a significant impact on his audience in the early decades of the 20th century. </p></div>
