Geoffrey. <em>The Psychology and Physiology of Light and Color as an Issue in the Planning and Managing of Environments: A Selected Bibliography. </em>Monticello, IL: Council of Planning Librarians, 1972. Exchange Bibliography #288. 14 pp.</p><p class="annot">This 110-item bibliography begins with a short essay that explains its scope and limitations. Titles relate mainly to the psychology of light, for example, lighting and the design of environments and the study of environmental influences on behavior. Citations are arranged alphabetically by author and are not annotated. An especially useful feature of this bibliography is the inclusion of theses and papers in addition to a few books and many periodical citations. The lack of annotations makes it difficult to be certain, but color does not seem to be addressed in many of the titles cited.</p></div>
