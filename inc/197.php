ISBN 0-8230-2993-X </p><p class="annot">Topics in this watercolor course include color interaction, and warm-cool and muted-intense color contrasts. The author traces her own painting process from preparatory sketches and photographs and shows revisions and successful variations. She analyzes the weaknesses and strengths of each painting, just as she does with her master classes. Most important, her lessons show how the design and patterning of the surface may be handled simultaneously with color experimentation, thus merging the study of color and form. The many color illustrations range from useful color charts to color plates that showcase the work of many contemporary watercolorists. This book will be of special interest to readers who are attracted to the range of watercolors that often appear in American Artist magazine, which this collection resembles.</p></div>
