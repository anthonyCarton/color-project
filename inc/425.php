Boston: Cahners, 1968. 224 pp. Index, bibl. </p><p class="annot">Factors that contribute to color decisions and motivations that influence consumer actions are analyzed. Color trends and strategies for making color choices for products and packaging are also discussed. Danger emphasizes identifying the preferred colors while also maintaining the minimum number of colors that are adequate for market needs. The British viewpoint, lack of documentation, and age of this book may limit its usefulness to designers today. This is the American edition of Dangerâ€™s Using Colour to Sell, which presents the same text under a slightly different title. </p></div>
