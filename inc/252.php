ISBN 0-697-03959-5. </p><p class="annot">This popular introductory text is intended for study of artappreciation as well as for studio practice. It assumes that subject, form, and content are the main ingredients of art. Individual chapters focus on form, line, shape, value, texture, color, space, three-dimensional art, content and style. An elegant special feature of this sixth revision is the distribution of fine color plates throughout the book within discussions of the nature, properties and phenomena of color, and color relationships and usage. Other useful features include vocabularies for each chapter, a comprehensive glossary, and a three-page chronological outline of Western art. Projects for students are now available in an instructorâ€™s manual. </p></div>
