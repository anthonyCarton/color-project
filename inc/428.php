<div class="bibEntry"><p class="bib">428. Longyear, William. How to Use Colour in Advertising Design, Illustration and Painting. New York: Pitman, 1949. 40 pp. B/W illus., color illus. </p><p class="annot">Longyear was professor and chair of advertising design at the Pratt Institute. Written in the American how-to tradition, this book presents the pigment approach to color use with considerable attention to technique for painting and illustration. It includes such interesting features as a list of seven color combinations that are most legible at a distance and directives for successful use of color. It also provides information on color theory, illusions, phenomena, and psychology, with paintings, posters, and drawings used as examples. Although dated, this is one of the few works from the 1940s directed toward advertising design as well as illustration and painting. Longyear refers the reader to Munsell and to Egbert Jacobsonâ€™s Basic Color for more theoretical information. </p></div>
