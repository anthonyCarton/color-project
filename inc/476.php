London: George Allen & Unwin, 1950. 216 pp. Index, endnotes/footnotes, B/W illus. </p><p class="annot">A six-page chapter near the end of the book on color selection for packaging cites recognition, legibility, and evocation of an appropriate associational response as goals for package design. While the impact of some individual colors is suggested, no documentation is provided. The information is too brief and too dated to merit attention except within a historical context.</p></div>
